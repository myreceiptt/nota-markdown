# iBLOOMING Web3 Strategic Execution Plan (Living Document)

This document serves as the **living strategic execution guide** for iBLOOMING's transition into Web3, combining insights from the meetings on **July 10** and **July 11, 2025**. Unlike narrative meeting notes, this document summarizes what must be done, by whom, and why — and evolves over time.

---

## 📌 Summary of Strategic Conclusions (from Day 1 & Day 2)

1. The iBLOOMING ecosystem (apps, affiliates, commerce) is *already a working prototype* of ALPHA Coin and its tokenomics.
2. iBC (iBLOOMING Coin) should not be launched as a “Web3” or “crypto” product publicly — instead, it should act as a **silent mirror layer** to the existing fiat system.
3. Web3 is a **backend solution**, not a branding strategy.
4. All utilities of iBC must be **real and already happening**: access to educational products, affiliate rewards, BGC physical products, discounted purchases, etc.
5. Legal risk is manageable if the system is internally tokenized without being offered as a speculative asset to the public.

## 🧱 The 4 Execution Pillars (Confirmed)

| Pillar | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| **1. Web3 Login** | Implement smart wallet login across iBLOOMING apps | ✅ Validated by Founders |
| **2. ALPHA Coin** | Dummy coin for simulation of earn/spend behavior | ✅ Validated by Founders |
| **3. Tokenomics Development** | Using ALPHA Coin data to build real iBC model | 🔄 In progress (informally via BGC) |
| **4. iBLOOMING Coin (iBC)** | Fungible token replacing fiat in-app | ✅ Agreed in principle |

## 📊 Execution Matrix (Simulated - for Review)

| Task | Type | Resources Needed | Est. Time | Assigned To | Status |
|------|------|------------------|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Web3 Login on Mobile | One-time | Dev team, Wallet infra | 2–4 weeks | TBD | ⏳ Waiting |
| ALPHA Coin Distribution | Continuous | Smart Contract + Admin UI | 1–2 weeks setup | TBD | ⏳ Waiting |
| ALPHA Coin NFT Sink | Continuous | NFT store logic | 2–3 weeks | TBD | ⏳ Waiting |
| Analyze Earn/Spend Ratio | Continuous | Data analysis scripts | 2–3 weeks | Prof. NOTA + KK? | ⏳ Waiting |
| iBC Token Contract | One-time | Smart contract audit + launch | 3 weeks | Prof. NOTA | 🔒 Hold until Alpha Coin done |
| iBC Integration in Apps | Continuous | Payment module redesign | 2–4 weeks | TBD | 🔒 Hold |
| Liquidity Strategy | One-time | Off-chain/On-chain ratio logic | 2–4 weeks | TBD | 🔒 Hold |

---

## 🔜 Immediate Next Steps (Q3 2025)

### Phase 1: Foundation Layer
- [ ] Finalize Web3 Login implementation plan (mobile first)
- [ ] Setup ALPHA Coin as off-chain simulation
- [ ] Deploy dummy NFT products purchasable by ALPHA Coin
- [ ] Begin behavior analysis to determine saving/spending ratios

### Phase 2: Real Token Preparation
- [ ] Synthesize tokenomics draft from Alpha Coin data
- [ ] Design iBC contract and its liquidity mechanism
- [ ] Mirror fiat transaction system on-chain silently
- [ ] Integrate iBC as a replacement unit of value internally

## 👤 Role Clarification & Suggested Assignments

| Role | Person | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Tokenomics Architect | Prof. NOTA | Leading model & whitepaper |
| Legal & Compliance | KK | To validate real use with local/international law |
| Platform Integration | Ivan + Dev Team | Wallet, Token, NFT, Payment modules |
| Data & Analytics | TBD | Needed for behavior analysis of Alpha Coin |
| Strategy Lead | Mr. Onggy | Bridging vision + execution + risk readiness |

---

## ⚠️ Risk Considerations

- **Token Classification Risk**: iBC must not be seen as public speculative asset.
- **User Onboarding Confusion**: UX must mask crypto layer unless necessary.
- **Liquidity vs Revenue**: BGC + iBLOOMING must preserve real income.

## 📆 Milestone Planning

| Milestone | Deadline (Tentative) |
|----------|----------------------|
| Alpha Coin Live | September 2025 |
| Earn/Spend Data Ready | October 2025 |
| Tokenomics Draft Final | November 2025 |
| iBC Deployment (Silent) | December 2025 |
| Full Internal Utility | January 2026 |

---

## 📒 Change Log

- **2025-08-05**: Consolidated Day 1 & 2 into strategic execution document.
- **2025-08-06** *(Planned)*: Add Day 3 updates + NFT sink implementation timeline.

This document is maintained by Prof. NOTA as a living reference. Every confirmed update should reflect implementation clarity, business alignment, and token integrity.
