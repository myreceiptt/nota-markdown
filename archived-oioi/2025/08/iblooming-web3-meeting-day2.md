# 📒 iBLOOMING x Prof. NOTA – Web3 Transition Meeting  
**Day 2 Summary — 11 July 2025**  
**Location:** iBLOOMING HQ, Jakarta  
**Attendees:**  
- The 5 Founders of iBLOOMING (excluding Yuku in late session)  
- Prof. NOTA (v.11.11)  
- Janet (Operations & Liaison)

---

## ☕ Morning Reflection and Informal Session

The morning began with a casual yet meaningful breakfast conversation between Prof. NOTA and the Founders. Though the [`iBLOOMING-Web3-Meeting-Day1`](https://baca.endhonesa.com/all-notas-markdowns/~gitbook/pdf?page=u7cWvEAZRNFOnaeRQrvk&only=yes&limit=100) file had not been distributed, Prof. NOTA shared key ideas informally — mirroring the five “next steps” outlined in the document:

1. Validate the 4 execution pillars with all Founders  
2. Assign responsible persons and timelines  
3. Begin Phase 1 implementation: Web3 Login + ALPHA Coin setup  
4. Observe user behavior, process data, and design final tokenomics  
5. Release iBLOOMING Coin into the ecosystem with real utility  

Using concrete examples and real use cases, Prof. NOTA engaged the Founders in active dialogue about strategy, uncertainty, and vision — speaking intuitively, as though seeing a path forward "like a daydream at noon."

## 📊 Presentation: BGC Marketing Model by KK

Upon Mr. Onggy’s cue, KK formally presented the **Bloo Global Company (BGC)** marketing model — a multi-tier affiliate + MLM structure that:

- Offers lifetime commissions and rebates
- Is powered by “Purchase Credit” for BGC product purchases
- Provides affiliate access and special privileges to iBLOOMING content
- Encourages team building and performance-based growth

This model, already in use for two years, structurally reflects many behaviors and flows outlined in the ALPHA Coin simulation — without being on-chain.

Prof. NOTA saw this moment as a key turning point:  
> “What I imagined as Alpha Coin has already been living inside BGC and iBLOOMING — as Purchase Credits, Sales Points, referral layers, and profit-sharing pools.”

## 🗣 Yuku's Speaks (in Cantonese / Hong Kong language)

After KK’s presentation, Yuku took the floor — presenting and questioning extensively in Hong Kong/Cantonese. While the rest of the Founders were fluent, Prof. NOTA did not understand the language.

KK was then asked by Mr. Onggy to explain the core summary to Prof. NOTA in English.

### 🧩 Key Clarifications:
- Two companies were formed two years ago:
  - **iBLOOMING Company** – a digital content ecommerce platform
  - **Bloo Global Company (BGC)** – an MLM structure for product and affiliate growth
- iBLOOMING handles fiat-based transactions for e-products (GiM, iMatrix)
- BGC handles offline/physical products and affiliate expansion using fiat-based Purchase Credits and Sales Points
- Affiliates receive content access, product discounts, and revenue-sharing from both companies

### ❓ Yuku’s Strategic Questions:
1. **How to determine iBLOOMING Coin (iBC) price?**  
2. **How to ensure a stable pairing ratio between iBC and BTC?**  
3. **Can iBC become a core product instead of having to make digital/physical goods?**  
4. **How will iBC be utilized across all apps and partner ecosystems?**  
5. **What are the legal implications and requirements of launching iBC?**

Yuku framed these as part of anticipating the “worst-case scenario.”

## 🧠 Prof. NOTA’s Response

In closing the session, Prof. NOTA offered a calm, structured response:

1. **Stop obsessing over the worst-case scenario. Instead, build a system where worst-case is irrelevant.**  
2. **iBLOOMING and BGC have operated for 2 years without major legal or financial disruption — just keep going.**  
3. **Internally tokenize all transactions. Replace fiat with iBC without changing the frontend experience.**

### 🔧 Proposed Mechanism:
- When a user pays in fiat, the backend system buys iBC in real-time
- The user then uses iBC to make the purchase (invisibly)
- Blockchain becomes a backend mirror — like using a database
- No need to hype “Web3” to the public. No FOMO. Only utility.

> *"We’re not switching to Web3 — we’re mirroring it. Like we already did with SQL or NoSQL. Blockchain is just the next mirror.”*

---

## 🧱 Mr. Onggy’s Final Note (End of Day)

Before closing the meeting, Mr. Onggy reminded the team:

> “Every business carries risk. Even life carries risk. So don’t fear Yuku’s questions — just stay focused on making iBC real.”

## 🧾 Ivan’s Strategic Summary

Ivan closed the meeting by identifying what Yuku was really trying to protect — five strategic outcomes:

1. **Increase Money** → Grow total company revenue  
2. **Reduce Cost** → Lower production and operational expenses  
3. **Reduce Tax** → Use crypto timing and logic to reduce fiat-based tax load  
4. **Increase Affiliators** → Recruit more affiliate investors in BGC  
5. **Increase Users** → Attract more product buyers in iBLOOMING
