# Living Document of Web3 Integration Guidance

_This document serves as the strategic and operational reference for the Web3 Integration of BGC & iBLOOMING, derived from founder discussions on July 10‚Äì11, 2025._

It compiles key insights from these discussions, confirms agreed decisions, and outlines the immediate next steps for execution.

This living document is to be read, updated, and agreed upon by all founders, serving as a unified point of reference to keep the integration process synchronized and on track.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Definition Note**:
>
> - _ALPHA Coin_ = Codified interpretation of BGC & iBLOOMING‚Äôs reward system from 2023‚Äì2025.
> - _iBC/iBTC_ = Upcoming on-chain token system based on ALPHA Coin data and behavior.
> - _Simulation_ = Business/operational analysis of existing system data, without building new components unless explicitly stated.

## üîç CORE CONTEXT

Since 2023, **BGC & iBLOOMING** have operated in parallel ‚Äî iBLOOMING as a digital product platform, and BGC as an affiliate reward engine. This parallel operation forms the foundation of what is now defined as **ALPHA Coin**.

**ALPHA Coin** has already been active through BGC & iBLOOMING‚Äôs operational model as a real-world business simulation. (Source ‚Üí [Day 2 Summary](https://baca.endhonesa.com/all-notas-markdowns/~gitbook/pdf?page=sdXJQGydvzjLAL8ZtAw0&only=yes&limit=100#pdf-page-sdXJQGydvzjLAL8ZtAw0-presentation-bgc-marketing-model-by-kk))

Without explicitly naming it, BGC & iBLOOMING has effectively implemented **ALPHA Coin tokenomics** through the following existing mechanics:

- **Purchase Credit** = Value Token
- **Sales Point** = Activity Token / Reward Token
- **Profit Sharing** = Holding-Based Reward
- **Cross-App Utility** = BGC affiliate integration with iBLOOMING edu-products / gated access to iBLOOMING

This means the integration does not start from scratch ‚Äî it reframes, extracts insights, and elevates proven value logic that has been active since 2023. All details about the model formulation can be read in this document: [UNDERSTANDING Doc](https://baca.endhonesa.com/all-notas-markdowns/~gitbook/pdf?page=4Eh8GomcmSGx85uX6sBg&only=yes&limit=100).

## üß† STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES (Reaffirmed)

As reaffirmed during the founder discussions, the **iBC/iBTC token architecture** is designed to directly achieve these five critical business objectives:

1. **Increase Revenue** ‚Äì Grow overall income streams across the BGC & iBLOOMING ecosystem.
2. **Reduce Operational & Product Cost** ‚Äì Lower expenses through automated processes and on-chain efficiencies.
3. **Reduce Tax Burden via On-Chain Logic** ‚Äì Optimize tax exposure by leveraging compliant blockchain-based transaction structures.
4. **Grow Affiliate Network** ‚Äì Expand the number of active affiliates and strengthen their participation.
5. **Expand Active User Base** ‚Äì Increase total active users engaging with BGC & iBLOOMING products and services.

Each objective will be simulated, measured, and validated through actual token behavior and tangible utility, ensuring that all execution pillars (see Section 4) are aligned with these targets.
