# BGC × iBLOOMING — Alignment Call (Preparation Sprint v0.1)

## 1. Call Objectives

- Confirm a shared understanding of the current status:
  - AS-IS BGC rewards and existing (Web2) system.
  - TO-BE vision with ALPHA on Base and Web3 Login by Yuku.
- Agree on the scope and priorities of a short “Preparation Sprint” while Web3 Login is being implemented.
- Decide on immediate next steps, owners, and a rough timeline.

---

## 2. Context (Short)

- Web3 Login implementation is in progress (Yuku).
- Instead of waiting passively, we use this time to:
  - Stabilize the **story & tokenflow model**.
  - Test assumptions using **past BGC data**.
  - Define a realistic and limited **Pilot v1**.

---

## 3. Topics to Cover

### 3.1 Narrative & Tokenflow Basics

- Short value proposition of BGC × iBLOOMING (why it exists and for whom).
- AS-IS → TO-BE:
  - How PC/SP (or equivalent points) map into ALPHA.
  - Append-only event model and hashed evidence.
  - Cash-out windows and KYC boundaries (high-level, non-technical).

### 3.2 Data & Simulation

- What historical BGC data we have (format, granularity, accessibility).
- Time range to use (e.g. last 1–2 years).
- Simple simulation plan:
  - “If ALPHA had existed from day one, what would member balances look like today?”
  - Fairness criteria and extreme cases.
- What outputs KK needs from the simulation (for finance/legal comfort).

### 3.3 Pilot v1 Shape

- Target profile and approximate number of participants.
- Pilot duration.
- What participants can earn/redeem and under what conditions.
- Operational roles:
  - Who handles support and questions.
  - Who reviews KYC/cash-out issues.
  - Who is allowed to adjust parameters during the pilot.

### 3.4 Governance, Legal & Risk (High-Level)

- KK’s view on:
  - ToS and disclaimers (non-investment, no guaranteed returns, etc.).
  - Basic privacy/data statement.
  - Handling suspicious or abusive behavior (freeze, block, etc.).

---

## 4. Expected Outcomes

By the end of the call, we aim to have:

- Agreement on the **Preparation Sprint** structure and workstreams.
- A list of **data requests** and a person responsible for gathering them.
- Clarity on:
  - What we can already move forward with (before Web3 Login is ready).
  - When and how to involve Yuku in a focused tech session.
