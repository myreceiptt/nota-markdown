# Building the NFT Layer of Web3: Interoperability, Modularity, and the Web3 Stack Protocol

## Executive Summary

As the Web3 ecosystem evolves, the need for **standardized, modular, and interoperable NFT infrastructure** becomes critical. This paper explores how the **Web3 Stack Protocol** offers a blueprint to structure NFT ecosystems — from minting and metadata to identity and display — in a way that is **composable, sustainable, and portable** across chains and apps.

---

## Background

The early NFT boom was marked by fragmentation — different metadata schemas, isolated platforms, and vendor lock-ins. The Web3 Stack Protocol aims to address this by defining a **layered approach to Web3 architecture**, enabling clear modular boundaries for each component.

---

## NFT Stack Layers in Web3 Stack Protocol

| Layer | Function | Examples |
|-------|----------|----------|
| **Wallet & Identity Layer** | Manages ownership and identity | WalletConnect, Smart Wallets, ERC-4337 |
| **Asset Layer (NFT)** | Defines and mints NFTs | ERC-721, ERC-1155, Soulbound, Lazy Minting |
| **Metadata Layer** | Stores and retrieves token data | IPFS, Arweave, NFT.Storage |
| **Display Layer** | Renders NFTs in apps/platforms | OpenSea, Zora, custom UI libraries |
| **Interoperability Layer** | Enables NFT use across ecosystems | Lens Protocol, Wallet-bound NFTs, Cross-chain bridges |

---

## Use-Cases Enhanced by Structured NFT Stack

- **Education NFTs (e.g. iBLOOMING)**  
  → Modular identity, badge minting, and proof-of-progress tracking

- **Gaming & Collectibles**  
  → Plug-and-play with different wallets, marketplaces, and display apps

- **Reputation Systems**  
  → Combine ERC-725/735 identity + NFT progress badges

- **Decentralized Publishing**  
  → NFT-based authorship, licensing, and proof-of-creation

---

## iBLOOMING Application

iBLOOMING can use the Web3 Stack Protocol to:

- Separate **user wallet identity** from claimable NFTs
- Modularize NFT types (learning badge, mentor role, content license)
- Standardize metadata for cross-platform compatibility
- Future-proof the system for L2 or multichain deployment

---

## Recommendations

| Area | Stack Protocol Advice |
|------|-----------------------|
| Minting | Use modular minting services (ThirdWeb, Manifold) |
| Metadata | Store off-chain via IPFS + fallback JSON structure |
| UX Layer | Implement flexible NFT viewers with display fallback |
| Interoperability | Define metadata schema that maps across platforms |

---

## Conclusion

The NFT layer is not a silo — it’s a protocol. By adopting the Web3 Stack Protocol, NFT ecosystems become more **resilient, interoperable, and composable**. This enables long-term value, especially in education, identity, and cultural memory.
