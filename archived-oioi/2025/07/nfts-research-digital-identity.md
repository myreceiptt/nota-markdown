# NFTs as Self-Sovereign Identity: Exploring ERC-725 & ERC-735 in Decentralized Digital Identity Systems

## Executive Summary

While NFTs are commonly associated with art and collectibles, their true potential extends into the realm of **digital identity**. This research focuses on how standards such as **ERC-725 (Key-Value Identity)** and **ERC-735 (Claim Registry)** enable **NFTs to function as self-sovereign identity objects**, with use-cases beyond ownership — toward **verification, access control, and reputation**.

---

## Background

The current Web2 identity systems rely on centralized accounts, opaque data, and external KYC processes. NFTs — especially **Soulbound NFTs (non-transferable)** — can represent verified, on-chain **identity proofs** or **behavioral records**, attached to an individual’s wallet in a verifiable way.

Standards such as ERC-725 and ERC-735 provide a programmable structure for identity and claims.

## Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **ERC-725** | Standard for key-value storage of identity attributes on-chain (name, email, role, etc.) |
| **ERC-735** | Mechanism to store and manage third-party claims about an identity (e.g., “KYC verified by X”) |
| **NFT Identity Object** | A non-transferable NFT that carries metadata linked to identity |
| **Soulbound NFT** | Non-transferable NFT bound to one wallet, ideal for identity or certificates |

---

## Use-Cases in Web3 Ecosystems

1. **Verifiable Web3 Resume**  
   → NFTs hold learning badges, skill endorsements, contributor history

2. **Access Rights**  
   → Smart contract gates based on roles stored in ERC-725 NFT

3. **Decentralized KYC**  
   → ERC-735 claims issued by third parties (auditors, DAOs, institutions)

4. **Community Membership**  
   → Identity NFTs grant access to Discords, voting, or gated content

---

## Interoperability & Privacy Notes

- ERC-725 profiles are public by design → must **limit sensitive fields**
- Encryption layer (e.g., Lit Protocol) can add **selective disclosure**
- Multiple identities per user wallet can be deployed via NFT issuance from separate contracts

---

## Opportunities & Risks

| Opportunity | Risk |
|-------------|------|
| Modular identity system interoperable across DAOs & DApps | Sensitive data exposure if poorly designed |
| Identity verification without central authority | Risk of false claims or sybil attacks |
| Reputation building in open ecosystems | Reputation can be gamed or sold |

---

## Conclusion

ERC-725 and ERC-735 open new possibilities for NFTs to move beyond collectibles — toward **verifiable, self-owned identity systems**. By using NFTs as programmable identity objects, the Web3 ecosystem can build trust without compromising sovereignty.
