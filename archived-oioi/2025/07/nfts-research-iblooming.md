# NFTs for Adaptive Learning: A Case Study of iBLOOMING COIN as a Simulation of Educational Value Distribution

## Executive Summary

iBLOOMING is a Web3-based education ecosystem that has designed **iBLOOMING COIN** as a loyalty token for learners and mentors. In its early phase, the coin is not tradable on public markets, but is used to **simulate the dynamics of value distribution, purchasing power, and retention behavior** around educational content and user interaction.

This research explores how NFTs can enhance and extend this strategy.

---

## Background

In traditional education systems, it is difficult to track and reward user participation in a verifiable and equitable way. NFTs provide iBLOOMING with a mechanism to:

- Record each **learning interaction** as a unique on-chain asset.
- Issue **NFTs as learning badges**, which are immutable and verifiable credentials.
- Distribute **NFT-based rewards** to content creators and mentors.

## Use-Cases of NFTs in iBLOOMING

| NFT Type | Function | Distribution | Added Value |
|----------|----------|--------------|-------------|
| **Learning Badge NFT** | Proof of participation or course completion | Automatically issued after completing a course | Unlocks access to premium content |
| **Mentor Contribution NFT** | Records educator contributions | Based on community ratings and evaluations | Redeemable for iBLOOMING COIN |
| **Profile NFT (Soulbound)** | Represents learner identity | Tied to user wallet | Forms part of the educational reputation system |
| **Project NFT** | User-generated project artifacts (assignments, videos) | Minted by learners themselves | Can be used as a verifiable portfolio |

---

## Long-Term Potential

- **Interoperability** across education platforms
- **NFTs as credentials** for entry into advanced programs or job applications
- **NFT-based Education Marketplace** (mentor-booking, peer-review curation, learning DAOs)

---

## Ethical Notes & Recommendations

- NFTs in education must remain **non-speculative**.
- All NFTs should serve an **educational or reputational purpose**, not mere collectibles.
- **Metadata standardization** is critical for long-term interoperability and recognition.

---

## Conclusion

NFTs in iBLOOMING are not mere digital collectibles — they are mechanisms of **identity, proof, and educational incentives** that may transform how we acknowledge and reward learning in decentralized systems.
