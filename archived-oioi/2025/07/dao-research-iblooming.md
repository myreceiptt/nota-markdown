# Simulating an Educational DAO: Building Decentralized Governance in the iBLOOMING Ecosystem

## Executive Summary

iBLOOMING is piloting the use of loyalty tokens (Alpha Coin) to test how communities react to educational value. Beyond rewards, this framework can evolve into a DAO model where **curriculum, mentor evaluation, and incentive allocation are governed collectively**.

This paper presents a simulation model and a roadmap for a functional Educational DAO.

## Why DAO for iBLOOMING?

1. **Empower learners with governance rights** — let them vote on topics, content ratings, and mentor feedback.
2. **Enable transparent community treasury management** — allocate funds where they’re needed most.
3. **Establish adaptive curriculum shaping** — proposals for new content emerge from community interest.

## Simulated DAO Structure

| Component | Description | Tools |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| **Token Voting** | Alpha Coin used to vote on topics and feedback | Snapshot (off-chain) |
| **Workstream Teams** | Curriculum, mentor review, and moderation teams | Aragon / Gnosis Safe |
| **Proposal System** | Anyone can propose new modules or changes | GitHub + Forum + Token Voting |
| **Mentor Evaluation DAO** | Learners rate and review mentors | Wallet-linked reputation system |

---

## Challenges and Proposed Solutions

| Challenge | Proposed Solution |
|----------|--------------------|
| Voting dominated by few active users | Weighted voting via reputation + participation history |
| Reward farming or abuse | Soulbound IDs + Proof of Learning requirements |
| Lack of DAO onboarding literacy | Gamified tutorials & progressive participation |

---

## Suggested Implementation Phases

1. **Alpha Phase**: Off-chain voting with community forums
2. **Beta Phase**: Gnosis Safe-based treasury and limited proposal testing
3. **Gamma Phase**: Fully open DAO governance across user roles

---

## Conclusion

A DAO is not just about token voting — it's about **decentralized ownership of knowledge and participation**. iBLOOMING holds the opportunity to become Southeast Asia's first functional and inclusive Educational DAO, designed for real learners, not just speculative actors.
