# Understanding Affiliate & Rewards (BGC & iBLOOMING)

## 0. Users in BGC & iBLOOMING

In the BGC & iBLOOMING ecosystem, a **user** is anyone who transacts—whether a one-time purchase, a subscription, or simply a sign-up—and uses or benefits from the ongoing operations of BGC & iBLOOMING. A **user** can be an individual or an organization.

Below are the user types within the BGC & iBLOOMING ecosystem:

| Base Type       | Subtype       | Channel Provider (CP) | Executive CP | WEC User |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------|--------------|----------|
| General User    | —             | ✓                     | ✓            | ✗        |
| Affiliate User  | Pathfinder    | ✓                     | ✓            | ✗        |
| Affiliate User  | Voyager       | ✓                     | ✓            | ✗        |
| Affiliate User  | Explorer      | ✓                     | ✓            | ✗        |
| Affiliate User  | Pioneer       | ✓                     | ✓            | ✓        |
| Affiliate User  | Special       | ✓                     | ✓            | ✓        |

**Legend:** ✓ = can / yes, ✗ = can't / no

**Note on Channel Provider (CP) eligibility:** A ✓ under “Channel Provider (CP)” indicates **eligibility to become a CP** subject to BGC & iBLOOMING program requirements (e.g., application and approval, adherence to channel policies, and ongoing compliance). It does **not** imply automatic CP status.

**Note on Executive CP eligibility:** A ✓ under “Executive CP” indicates **eligibility to become an Executive CP** subject to additional requirements set by BGC & iBLOOMING (e.g., being an approved CP first, meeting elevated performance/quality thresholds, and periodic review). It does **not** imply automatic Executive CP status.

**Note on WEC User eligibility:** A ✓ under “WEC User” indicates **eligibility to become a WEC User** provided the user later meets the WEC criteria (e.g., the USD 10,000 payout threshold within 60 days, as defined elsewhere). It does **not** imply automatic WEC status.

## 1. Affiliate & Entry

Bloo Global Company (BGC) utilizes an **Affiliate Membership** system with five levels. Each level can only be purchased and paid for with fiat (USD). After purchasing and paying with fiat, the **user** officially becomes an **Affiliate User**.

| **Level**  | **Entry Fee (USD)** |
| ---------- | ------------------: |
| Pathfinder | $100.00             |
| Voyager    | $500.00             |
| Explorer   | $1,725.00           |
| Pioneer    | $2,875.00           |
| Special    | $11,500.00          |

➡️ **Important Notes:**
- The **Entry Fee** is the fiat on-ramp into the BGC system.
- After paying with fiat, the **Affiliate User** receives **Purchase Credit**.

---

## 2. Purchase Credit (PC)

- Definition: **Purchase Credit** is not only the counterpart of the fiat paid, but also proof of **Affiliate Membership** as well as a credit balance to buy physical products at BGC. It functions like an internal currency for purchasing physical products at BGC.
- Ratio: **100 PC = $1.00 USD** (fixed, non-volatile).
- Functions:
  - Serves as evidence that BGC sells physical products (MLM legal requirement).
  - Because the **Affiliate User** has received **Purchase Credit**, the company **has no obligation to refund** the fiat paid to BGC.

➡️ Additional Notes:
- At BGC, **Affiliate Membership** cannot be purchased/paid using **Purchase Credit**. **Affiliate Membership** can only be purchased with fiat. In short, within BGC: fiat in → **PC** increases → physical product out → **PC** decreases.

---

## 3. World Executive Club (WEC)

- Definition: A **WEC User** is an additional status available only to **Affiliate Users** at **Pioneer** or **Special** level whose **accumulated payout from BGC rewards based on Sales Points-Referral (RR) and Generation Reward (GR)**-reaches **$10,000.00** within **60 consecutive days**.
- Start Date & Window: The **Affiliate User** selects the **starting date** for the 60-day window. If the **$10,000.00** threshold is **not** reached within that window, the attempt is considered **failed and reset**, and the user may select a **new starting date** for a subsequent attempt.
- Permanence: Once the threshold is met within the specified 60 days, **WEC User** status becomes **permanent**.
- Level Independence: **WEC User** does **not** replace the **Affiliate User** level (**Pioneer or Special**); it is an **additional** status.

---

## 4. Sales Points (SP) & Life Time Scholar (LTS)

### What are Sales Points (SP)?
**Sales Points (SP)** are a notional unit (not a coin) used to measure the rewards an **Affiliate User** will receive, calculated and distributed using **Life Time Scholar (LTS)** as the base reference.

### Life Time Scholar (LTS) — by Affiliate Level
Whenever a new **Affiliate User** is added, **Sales Points** equal to **70% of the Entry Fee** are generated. These Sales Points are called **Life Time Scholar (LTS)**.

| Affiliate Level | LTS (SP) |
|-----------------|---------:|
| Pathfinder      | 70 SP    |
| Voyager         | 350 SP   |
| Explorer        | 1,207 SP |
| Pioneer         | 2,012 SP |
| Special         | 8,050 SP |

➡️ Fixed Value: **1 SP = $1.00** (for calculation; non-volatile).  
➡️ Detailed **SP** acquisition & distribution mechanics will be elaborated in the following chapter.

    - The $30.00 (100% iBLOOMING Revenue) is allocated as:
      - **10% → Link Reward (LR)** for the **Affiliate User** → 10% × $30.00 = **$3.00**
      - **10% = 1% × 10 users → Miracle Cash (iBLOOMING-MC)** for the **user** → 10% × $30.00 = **$3.00**
      - **Channel Provider Reward (CPR):**
        - **5%** → CPR for the Affiliate User **in the first year** → 5% × $30.00 = **$1.50**
        - **2.5%** → CPR for the Affiliate User **in the second year and beyond** → 2.5% × $30.00 = **$0.75**
      - **15% → Global Profit Sharing (GPS)** → 15% × $30.00 = **$4.50**
      - **Remainder → iBLOOMING Profit:**
        - **60%** → iBLOOMING Profit **in the first year** → 60% × $30.00 = **$18.00**
        - **62.5%** → iBLOOMING Profit **in the second year and beyond** → 62.5% × $30.00 = **$18.75**

### Revenue Distribution for **GiM** sign-ups:

---

### 7.1 Link Reward (LR)

- **Definition:** Paid to an **Affiliate User** whenever a user buys a **CP User**’s digital product on iBLOOMING using the **Affiliate User**’s link.
- **Rate:** **10%** of iBLOOMING Revenue of each **CP User**’s digital product purchase.
- **Example (for a $100.00 purchase/transaction):**
  - **70% → CP User Revenue** → 70% × $100.00 = **$70.00**
  - **30% → iBLOOMING Revenue** → 30% × $100.00 = **$30.00**
    - From this **$30.00** (100% iBLOOMING Revenue), **10%** is allocated as **Link Reward** for the **Affiliate User** → 10% × $30.00 = **$3.00**

**Payout Frequency:** Monthly (aggregated). If, in a month, 100 users each make 3 purchases averaging $100.00, the **Affiliate User**’s total **Link Reward** is:  
`100 users × 3 purchases × $100.00 × 30% × 10% = $900.00`.

---

### 7.2 Miracle Cash (iBLOOMING-MC)

- **Definition:** Paid to **users** (not limited to **Affiliate Users** or **CP Users**). After a **user** buys a **CP User**’s digital product on iBLOOMING, they receive **Miracle Cash** each time another **user** buys a **CP User**’s digital product—capped at **10** subsequent purchases.
- **Rate:** **1%** of iBLOOMING Revenue of each **CP User**’s digital product purchase.
- **Example (for a $100.00 purchase/transaction):**
  - **70% → CP User Revenue** → 70% × $100.00 = **$70.00**
  - **30% → iBLOOMING Revenue** → 30% × $100.00 = **$30.00**
    - From this **$30.00** (100% iBLOOMING Revenue), **1%** is allocated as **Miracle Cash** for the **user** → 1% × $30.00 × 10 users = **$3.00**

**Payout Frequency:** Monthly (aggregated). If, in a month, a user makes 1 purchase and, after the purchase, there are 10 subsequent purchases by others, each averaging $100.00, then the user’s total **Miracle Cash** is:  
`1 purchase × 10 subsequent purchases × $100.00 × 30% × 1% = $3.00`.

---

### 7.3 Channel Provider Reward (CPR)

- **Definition:** Paid to an **Affiliate User** who brings a **CP User** into iBLOOMING, when the **CP User**’s digital product is sold/purchased by **users**.
- **Rate:** **5%** of iBLOOMING Revenue in the **first year**, then **2.5%** in the **second year and beyond**.
- **Example (for a $100.00 purchase/transaction):**
  - **70% → CP User Revenue** → 70% × $100.00 = **$70.00**
  - **30% → iBLOOMING Revenue** → 30% × $100.00 = **$30.00**
    - From this **$30.00** (100% iBLOOMING Revenue):
        - **5%** is allocated as **CPR** for the **Affiliate User** in the **first year** → 5% × $30.00 = **$1.50**
        - **2.5%** is allocated as **CPR** for the **Affiliate User** in the **second year and beyond** → 2.5% × $30.00 = **$0.75**

**Payout Frequency:** Monthly (aggregated), as long as the **CP User**’s digital product continues generating revenue.

---

### 7.4 GiM Referral Reward (GRR)

- **Definition:** Paid to an **Affiliate User** whenever a **user** signs up for GiM using the **Affiliate User**’s link. The reward is tiered with two pathways: **Individual** and **Organization**.
- **Rates (per sign-up, same totals for both pathways):**
  - **Individual Referral:** **$3.00** → First-Tier **Affiliate User**; **$0.80** → Second-Tier **Affiliate User**; **$0.20** → **WEC User** Pool (Third-Tier).
  - **Organization Referral:** **$3.00** → First-Tier **Organization**; **$0.80** → Second-Tier **Affiliate User**; **$0.20** → **WEC User** Pool (Third-Tier).
- **WEC User Pool (Third-Tier) Note:** **WEC User** = World Executive Club. The **$0.20** Third-Tier amount does not go to a single upline; it is paid into the **WEC User** Pool and split equally among all **WEC Users** at payout time.

**Payout Frequency:** Monthly (aggregated). If there are **100** GiM sign-ups in a month (from any mix of Individual/Organization referrals), the **GRR** then:  
- **Tier 1 (Affiliate User/Organization):** `$3.00 × 100 = $300.00`  
- **Tier 2 (Affiliate User):** `$0.80 × 100 = $80.00`  
- **Tier 3 (WEC User Pool):** `$0.20 × 100 = $20.00` → split equally among all **WEC Users** (e.g., 50 **WEC Users** → **$0.40** each)

---

### 7.5 iMATRIX Referral Reward (iRR)

- **Definition:** Paid to an **Affiliate User** whenever a **user** purchases an iMATRIX plan via the **Affiliate User**’s link. The reward is tiered with two pathways: **Individual** and **Organization**, based on the plan type. *(iMATRIX plans are one-time purchases.)*
- **Rates (per plan purchase; same totals for both pathways):**
  - **Foundation:** **$0.60** → Tier 1; **$0.25** → Tier 2; **$0.10** → **WEC User** Pool (Tier 3)
  - **Pro:** **$5.00** → Tier 1; **$2.50** → Tier 2; **$1.00** → **WEC User** Pool (Tier 3)
  - **Expert:** **$12.00** → Tier 1; **$5.00** → Tier 2; **$2.00** → **WEC User** Pool (Tier 3)
- **WEC User Pool (Tier-3) Note:** **WEC User** = World Executive Club. The Tier-3 amount does not go to a single upline; it is paid into the **WEC User** Pool and split equally among all **WEC Users** at payout time.

**Payout Frequency:** Monthly (aggregated). If the month has **250 Foundation**, **150 Pro**, and **100 Expert** plan purchases (from any mix of Individual/Organization referrals), then the **iRR** totals are:  
- **Tier 1 (Affiliate User/Organization):** `($0.60 × 250) + ($5.00 × 150) + ($12.00 × 100) = $150.00 + $750.00 + $1,200.00 = $2,100.00`  
- **Tier 2 (Affiliate User):** `($0.25 × 250) + ($2.50 × 150) + ($5.00 × 100) = $62.50 + $375.00 + $500.00 = $937.50`  
- **Tier 3 (WEC User Pool):** `($0.10 × 250) + ($1.00 × 150) + ($2.00 × 100) = $25.00 + $150.00 + $200.00 = $375.00` → split equally among all **WEC Users**

### 7.6 Global Profit Sharing (GPS)

- **Definition:** **GPS** is a profit pool from iBLOOMING—including profit sourced from **CP User** digital product sales, GiM sign-ups, and iMATRIX plan purchases (one-time)—distributed to top-level **Affiliate Users** (**Explorer**, **Pioneer**, **Special**). GPS has three profit sources:

  1) **15%** of iBLOOMING revenue from each **CP User** digital product purchase.  
     - **Example (for a $100.00 purchase):**  
       - 70% → **CP User** revenue = **$70.00**  
       - 30% → iBLOOMING revenue = **$30.00**  
       - From this **$30.00**, **15% → GPS = $4.50**
  
  2) **$1.00** from each GiM sign-up (fixed; goes directly to **GPS**).  
  3) **$0.10 / $1.50 / $3.00** from each iMATRIX plan purchase (**Foundation / Pro / Expert**, fixed; goes directly to **GPS**).

- **Eligible Levels:** **Explorer, Pioneer, Special** only.  
  - **Explorer** → **2 shares**  
  - **Pioneer** → **3 shares**  
  - **Special** → **15 shares**

- **Payout Frequency:** Every **6 months** (unlike **LR, iBLOOMING-MC, GRR, iRR, CPR**, which are monthly).  
  - **Illustrative distribution:**  
    - Eligible Affiliates at payout: **550 Explorer**, **300 Pioneer**, **200 Special**  
      - Total shares = (550 × 2) + (300 × 3) + (200 × 15) = **5,000**  
    - **GPS** pool (semiannual):  
      - From **CP User** digital products = **$10,000,000.00**  
      - From **GiM** sign-ups = **$15,000,000.00**  
      - From **iMATRIX** plan purchases = **$25,000,000.00**  
      - **Total GPS = $50,000,000.00**  
    - **Value per share** = $50,000,000.00 ÷ 5,000 = **$10,000.00**  
    - **Estimated rewards:**  
      - **Explorer** = 2 × $10,000.00 = **$20,000.00**  
      - **Pioneer** = 3 × $10,000.00 = **$30,000.00**  
      - **Special** = 15 × $10,000.00 = **$150,000.00**

➡️ **Conclusion:** **GPS** is a large-scale, cross-product profit pool (**CP User** digital products, GiM, iMATRIX) distributed **semiannually** to **Explorer**, **Pioneer**, and **Special**.

### 7.7 Global Movement Pool (GMP)

- **Definition:** **GMP** is a **monthly** activity pool sourced only from **GiM** sign-ups and **iMATRIX** plan purchases (one-time), distributed to all **WEC Users** and **Executive CP**.

- **Sources (fixed per event):**  
  1) **$1.00** from each **GiM** sign-up (goes directly to **GMP**).  
  2) **$0.30 / $2.00 / $5.00** from each **iMATRIX** plan purchase (**Foundation / Pro / Expert**, respectively; goes directly to **GMP**).

- **Eligible Recipients:** All **WEC Users** and **Executive CP** present at the monthly payout snapshot.  
  - **Distribution rule:** Equal split per recipient (unless a different weighting is formally adopted later).

- **Payout Frequency:** **Monthly** (aggregated). **Illustrative distribution:**  
  - Monthly activity: **1,000** GiM sign-ups; **600 Foundation**, **300 Pro**, **100 Expert** iMATRIX plan purchases  
  - **GMP** pool total:  
    `($1.00 × 1,000) + ($0.30 × 600) + ($2.00 × 300) + ($5.00 × 100)`  
    `= 1,000.00 + 180.00 + 600.00 + 500.00 = **$2,280.00**`  
  - Eligible headcount at snapshot: **120 WEC Users** + **30 Executive CP** = **150** recipients  
  - **Payout per recipient:** `$2,280.00 ÷ 150 = **$15.20**`

➡️ **Conclusion:** **GMP** is a **monthly**, activity-driven pool (**GiM + iMATRIX**) paid **equally** to the current set of **WEC Users** and **Executive CP** at the payout snapshot.

### 7.8 Global Executive Committee (GEC)

- **Definition:** **GEC** is an **internal** iBLOOMING committee (not publicly marketed) responsible for executive oversight—covering governance, program integrity, operations, and strategic alignment of the iBLOOMING ecosystem.

- **Sources (fixed per event):**  
  - **$0.20** from each **GiM** sign-up.  
  - **$0.05 / $0.40 / $1.00** from each **iMATRIX** plan purchase (**Foundation / Pro / Expert**).

- **Eligibility & Membership:**  
  - **Appointment-based** and **internal** to iBLOOMING; membership may change over time by company decision.  
  - **Not** tied to Affiliate levels; separate from **WEC User**/**Executive CP** statuses.

- **Distribution:**  
  - **Monthly** (aggregated).  
  - **Equal split** among active **GEC** members at the payout snapshot (unless a different weighting is formally adopted later).

- **Illustrative distribution:**  
  - Monthly activity: **2,000** GiM sign-ups; **1,000 Foundation**, **400 Pro**, **150 Expert** iMATRIX plan purchases  
  - **GEC** pool total:  
    `($0.20 × 2,000) + ($0.05 × 1,000) + ($0.40 × 400) + ($1.00 × 150)`  
    `= 400.00 + 50.00 + 160.00 + 150.00 = **$760.00**`  
  - Active GEC members at snapshot: **10**  
  - **Payout per member:** `$760.00 ÷ 10 = **$76.00**`

➡️ **Conclusion:** **GEC** is a **monthly**, internally-governed pool that funds and rewards the executive oversight function of iBLOOMING, sourced from **GiM** and **iMATRIX** activity.
