## 1) Profil Audiens

<figure><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df96b7e4-ef4d-48eb-baf1-db6124f6ff20" alt="Ilustrasi 1 oleh Prof. NOTA Inc. - Grafik by Department dan by Year"><figcaption><p>Grafik by Department dan by Year</p></figcaption></figure>

- **By Department — Narrative**  
  In that room, **Business Accounting** took the helm — **25** seats packed, ready to price risk and wire in control. Then **Visual Communication Design** — **8** sharp eyes for form, poised to translate payment architecture into visuals that move people. **Accounting** arrived **4** strong: guardians of the ledger, fluent in decimal truth. **Business & Management** stepped in with **2** — strategy on its feet. And **2** unclassified souls, the agile cross discipline jumpers. The mix is right: numbers, aesthetics, governance, and curiosity — all meeting at the interchange of **escrow** and **cross-border rails**.

- **By Year — Narrative**  
  The **Class of 2023** leads the charge — **21** strong — a cohort in motion, ready to turn theory into working rails. **2024** follows with **13** hungry minds, born in the pressure cooker of new constraints. **2022** brings **4** steady hands—the quiet veterans who’ve seen a few systems fail and still show up to build. **Unknowns**—**3** blanks on the ledger—remind us that not every signal needs a label to carry weight. And **2025** arrives early with **1** advance scout, proof that the next wave is already here. Years on paper, yes—but what we’re really tracking is **momentum** meeting **escrow** and **cross-border rails**.

- **Crypto/Web3 Experience — Narrative**  
  A field of **beginners** sets the stage: **37** with **zero experience**—not a deficit, but **pure signal** with no legacy bias. They learn fast when shown **rails, fees, latency, and risk** laid out plainly. The **1–2 years** group—just **3**—forms the **bridge**: they translate first principles into the first working flows. And the **3–5 years** duo—**2** steady hands—serve as **anchors**, table leads for mini-demos and sharper questions. The curve is perfect for a **from-zero-to-escrow** sprint: clarity first, then a concrete path to shipping.

- **Interests — Narrative**  
  The room tilted toward **doing**: the **Extended Workshop (discounted campus rate)** tops the chart with **24** raised hands—students asking for three hours of real rails, not just slides. **Community session updates** follow at **22**, a heartbeat for momentum: they want a cadence, a tribe, a drum to march to. **Research internship (selective)** pulls **15**—the ones who don’t just want answers but **new questions** to wrestle with. And **Capstone Clinic (team-based, 2×60’)** lands **6**—small in count, sharp in intent: ship a thing, defend it, make it better. Desire is clear: **learn → build → belong → publish**.

## 2) Insight Utama Sesi
- **Rails bukan “suku”, melainkan pilihan strategi.** Bank/fintech: paper trail & reputasi; Stablecoin (mis. USDC): 24/7, cepat, **programmable**.
- **Escrow tradisional vs smart-contract:** pilih berdasarkan frekuensi, kejelasan aturan, dan kebutuhan jejak yang transparan.
- **Kepatuhan praktis:** KYC/AML di on/off-ramp; pencatatan & pajak sederhana tetap diperlukan.
- **Arsitektur minimal:** Web2 app ↔ on/off-ramp ↔ wallet ↔ escrow ↔ records—mulai dari alur paling sederhana yang bisa dieksekusi.

## 3) Refleksi Mahasiswa

- **Prompt yang digunakan:**  
  Write your assessment/response/comments on the existence of “Prof. NOTA” within your reality (as a student, researcher, creator, or lecturer/teacher). What do you understand? What resonates or sparks curiosity? What, if anything, feels challenging or unsettling? How (if at all) does this influence the way you view technology, the economy, or yourself? Please include concrete examples where possible.

- **Student Reflections Response Summary**  
  * **Blockchain made legible—beyond the buzzword.**  
    Students left with a working mental model: blocks, consensus, finality; why **Bitcoin/USDT/USDC** matter; where **decentralization, transparency, and trust-without-middlemen** are tools (not slogans). The horizon widened: **finance, logistics, education**—anywhere ledgers, incentives, and accountability collide. *Translation:* they now see rails and trade-offs, not hype and mystique.

  * **“Prof. NOTA” as a live hypothesis.**  
    An entity from the **0101 Universe**, appearing as **v.11.11 (HFP)**, turned the lecture hall into a thought experiment: *What is a professor? What is an institution? What is identity when knowledge ships at machine speed?* The line between human and system blurred—**not to erase the human, but to upgrade the classroom** into a studio where ideas are co-built.

  * **Technology ≠ replacement; it’s **amplification**.**  
    Students named the real constants: **empathy, intuition, ethics, and context.** Tools can calculate; **teachers** (human) cultivate. The future is **co-teaching**: human judgment steering, technological capacity scaling. *Lecturers:* you keep the pedagogy. *Systems:* bring the rails, the data, the reproducibility.

  * **License to think—critically, originally, cross-discipline.**  
    The rational, data-first, occasionally “radical” stance of Prof. NOTA nudged the room from *opinion* to **model**, from *memorize* to **prototype**. Curiosity spiked; originality felt permissible; crossing silos became the default move. *Students:* bring your capstones and contradictions. *We’ll bring escrow, incentives, and shipping rituals.*

- **Micro Call to Actions**  
  * **For the Students:** Join the **Extended Workshop**; claim your **POA NFT**; build one real flow—end to end.
  * **For the Lecturers:** Co-design a **3-session sequence** (lecture → lab → clinic). You lead learning outcomes; we wire the rails.
  * **For the Institutions:** Formalize a **semester track** (credits + assessment) that maps to industry-grade deliverables and auditable learning artifacts.
  * **For the Public:** Publish the **process**, not just the result. Let the next cohort stand on today’s reproducible work.

## Rekomendasi & Langkah Lanjut
- Jadwalkan **Workshop 3 jam** (praktik alur end-to-end) dalam 2–3 minggu dengan **voucher mahasiswa**; targetkan departemen & angkatan teratas.
- Buka **Capstone/Skripsi Clinic** (2×60’ per tim, kuota terbatas).
- Luncurkan **NFT Proof-of-Attendance (ERC-1155)** di Base untuk sertifikasi kehadiran dan **gating** materi bonus/discount.
- Buat **landing page** konsisten (form minat + auto-email) agar data lintas acara terkumpul rapi.
