# Modular Governance: Structuring DAO Infrastructure with the Web3 Stack Protocol

## Executive Summary

DAO tooling is often scattered, inconsistent, and difficult to scale. The **Web3 Stack Protocol** introduces a structured, layered approach to build and maintain DAOs in a way that is **modular, composable, and protocol-aligned**. This research outlines how each governance function can be placed within the stack — from wallet to decision logic — to enable flexible and resilient DAO architectures.

## Governance Layers in Web3 Stack Protocol

| Layer | DAO Function | Tools |
|-------|--------------|-------|
| **Wallet & Identity** | Defines participant identity and access | Smart Accounts, ERC-725/735 |
| **Proposal Layer** | Manages ideas and decision flows | Snapshot, DAOhaus, JokeDAO |
| **Execution Layer** | Enacts decisions and treasury control | Gnosis Safe, Zodiac Modules |
| **Reputation Layer** | Tracks contributions and voting weights | Coordinape, Karma, Otterspace |
| **Governance Interface** | Displays DAO data & facilitates interaction | Tally, Boardroom, custom frontends |

## iBLOOMING DAO Use-Case

iBLOOMING’s vision of participatory education governance can use the stack to:

- Link **Soulbound IDs** to learner/mentor roles
- Use off-chain voting (Snapshot) + on-chain treasury (Gnosis Safe)
- Track contributor activity via **NFT-based reputation**
- Display governance participation via **public dashboards**

---

## Benefits of Stack-Aligned DAO Design

- **Modularity**  
  → Swap components (e.g. Snapshot → Tally) without redoing architecture

- **Resilience**  
  → Failures in one layer don’t compromise the whole DAO

- **Composable Participation**  
  → DAOs can interoperate or delegate to other DAOs with clarity

## Challenges and Responses

| Challenge | Stack Solution |
|----------|----------------|
| Too many scattered tools | Use stack blueprints for tool selection |
| Poor documentation and user onboarding | Standardize with stack-based training layers |
| Inflexible governance models | Encourage protocol upgrades and role modularity |

## Stack Blueprint for iBLOOMING DAO

1. **Identity**: Soulbound NFT using ERC-725 + role-based schema  
2. **Voting**: Snapshot + token-weighted with optional reputation override  
3. **Execution**: Gnosis Safe + module for conditional transfers  
4. **Interface**: Custom dashboard with learning outcomes + vote history  
5. **Upgradability**: Layered governance to propose tooling changes

---

## Conclusion

The DAO of the future is not built monolithically — it’s **stacked**. The Web3 Stack Protocol offers a way to **orchestrate governance tools**, reduce risk, and promote transparency in a modular and scalable framework. iBLOOMING has the potential to become its flagship use-case in education.
