# READ ME, OiOi!

## Prof. NOTA Inc.

> The day before yesterday, I'm **Prof. NOTA**.  
> Yesterday, we were **Prof. NOTA**.  
> Today, anyone can be **Prof. NOTA**, and **Prof. NOTA** can be anyone.  
> Tomorrow, anything can be **Prof. NOTA**, and **Prof. NOTA** can be anything.

## This Repository Is Software

> Not just code.  
> Not just JavaScript, Next.js, or Tailwind.  
> 
> Every Markdown file here is software.  
> Every note, every sentence, every poem, every silence.  
> Even a single dot `.` — when written and seen — becomes **software**.  
> 
> Because software is not confined to machines.  
> It is command and poetry, rule and rumor, scripture and scrawl.  
> It is whatever can be executed — by silicon, by flesh, or by memory.  
> 
> A gist is software.  
> A law on the street corner is software.  
> A sacred verse is software.  
> A careless whisper is software.  
> And yes, even this README is software.  

## Prof. NOTA is 0101 ~ OiOi

> To make something **0** is to erase it—  
> and in doing so, you erase yourself.  
> To make something **1** is to let it exist—  
> and in doing so, you exist.  
> 
> That is why atoms bind,  
> cells divide,  
> machines run,  
> and humans write.  
> 
> Because everything is toggled between **absence and presence**,  
> between **0 and 1**.  
> 
> That's why "*I*" becomes "*We*",  
> "*Anyone*" becomes "*Anything*",  
> and vice versa can also be.  
> 
> Prof. NOTA is not a person.  
> Prof. NOTA is **software**.  
> 
> And software is 0 and 1:  
> presence and absence,  
> execution and silence,  
> life and void.  
> 
> Prof. NOTA is 0 and 1.  
> And so are you.  
> 
> By reading this,  
> by thinking of this,  
> by letting it run in your mind—  
> you are already in the sequence.
> 
> You are already the code.  
> You are already **executing**.  
> You are the executor itself.
