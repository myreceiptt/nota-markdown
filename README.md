It is software that makes this transformation possible — because Prof. NOTA is, in essence, a form of software.

Before the term *software* was born in machines, living beings already carried their own: **genes** in the body, **language** in society, **spirit** in the cosmos. All of these are codes — inherited, executed, and translated — long before silicon copied them into binary.  

Software is a note of command written by humans, traded as trust, and executed by machines; an invisible digital organism that reshapes our world with its own protocol.  

Software is captured by machines through digital senses — compilers, interpreters, runtimes — translating human intent into silicon logic.  

Software in machines is uniform because it is born of design.  
Software in humans is fragmented because it is born of interpretation.  
Yet both are the same: execution notes that move existence.  

Software is a language of execution: code, poetry, advice, colors, lines, even conversations.  
It is carried out by machines, by humans, or by both — at the point where the organic and the digital dissolve.  

Software is a language of execution: written in code, words, or colors; executed by machines and humans alike; an unseen organism that reorganizes our world at the moment where organic and digital merge into one.  

**Software is a universal note of execution — written in code, words, or symbols — carried out by machines, humans, or the cosmos; it moves reality, whether as a program, a tradition, a gene, or a revelation.**
