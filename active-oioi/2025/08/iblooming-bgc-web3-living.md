# Living Document of Web3 Transformation Guidance

📍 *This document serves as the strategic and operational reference for the Web3 transformation of iBLOOMING & BGC, derived from founder discussions on July 10–11, 2025.*

It compiles key insights from these discussions, confirms agreed decisions, and outlines the immediate next steps for execution.

- [📄 Day 1: 10 July 2025](../../../archived-oioi/2025/07/iblooming-web3-meeting-day1.md)
  - [Prof. NOTA Pitch](../../../archived-oioi/2025/07/iblooming-web3-pitch-simulation.md),
  - and [Present WEB3 DRAFT](../../../archived-oioi/2025/07/iblooming-web3-draft.md)  
- [📄 Day 2: 11 July 2025](../../../archived-oioi/2025/08/iblooming-web3-meeting-day2.md)
  - [Drafting Living Document](../../../archived-oioi/2025/08/iblooming-web3-living.md),
  - and [Drafting Understanding BGC X iBLOOMING Rewards](../../../archived-oioi/2025/08/bgc-iblooming-stage-1-rewards.md)

This living document is to be read, updated, and agreed upon by all founders — acting as a unified point of reference to keep the transformation process synchronized and on track.

> ℹ️ **Definition Note**:  
> - *ALPHA Coin* = Codified interpretation of BGC’s reward system from 2023–2025.  
> - *iBC/iBTC* = Upcoming on-chain token system based on ALPHA Coin data and behavior.  
> - *Simulation* = Business/operational analysis of existing system data, without building new components unless explicitly stated.

## 🔍 CORE CONTEXT

Since 2023, **iBLOOMING** and **BGC** have operated in parallel — iBLOOMING as a digital product platform, and BGC as an affiliate reward engine. This parallel operation forms the foundation of what is now defined as **ALPHA Coin**.

🎯 **ALPHA Coin** has already been active through BGC’s operational model as a real-world business simulation. (Source → [Day 2 Summary](../../../archived-oioi/2025/08/iblooming-web3-meeting-day2.md#-presentation-bgc-marketing-model-by-kk))

Without explicitly naming it, BGC has effectively implemented **ALPHA Coin tokenomics** through the following existing mechanics:

- **Purchase Credit** = Value Token  
- **Sales Point** = Activity Token / Reward Token  
- **Profit Sharing** = Holding-Based Reward  
- **Cross-App Utility** = Integration with iBLOOMING edu-products / gated access to iBLOOMING  

🎯 This means the transformation does not start from scratch — it reframes, extracts insights, and elevates proven value logic that has been active since 2023.
🎯 All details about the model formulation can be read in this document: [Understanding BGC X iBLOOMING Rewards](../../../active-oioi/2025/08/bgc-iblooming-stage1-rewards-en)

## 🧠 STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES (Reaffirmed)

As reaffirmed during the founder discussions, the **iBC/iBTC token architecture** is designed to directly achieve these five critical business objectives:

1. **Increase Revenue** – Grow overall income streams across the iBLOOMING & BGC ecosystem.  
2. **Reduce Operational & Product Cost** – Lower expenses through automated processes and on-chain efficiencies.  
3. **Reduce Tax Burden via On-Chain Logic** – Optimize tax exposure by leveraging compliant blockchain-based transaction structures.  
4. **Grow Affiliate Network** – Expand the number of active affiliates and strengthen their participation.  
5. **Expand Active User Base** – Increase total active users engaging with iBLOOMING & BGC products and services.

Each objective will be simulated, measured, and validated through actual token behavior and tangible utility, ensuring that all execution pillars (see Section 4) are aligned with these targets.

## 🧱 THE EXECUTION PILLARS – PROGRESS

These are the four validated **core execution pillars** agreed upon by all founders, serving as the foundation for the Web3 transformation of iBLOOMING & BGC. (Source → [Day 1: 4 Pillars Section](../../../archived-oioi/2025/07/iblooming-web3-meeting-day1.md#-the-4-execution-pillars))

**Progress Legend**: ✅ Live | 🛠 In Progress | 🧪 Planned

| Pillar                             | Description                                              | Progress       | Notes                                                       | Owner(s)                    |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| ALPHA Coin Layer                   | Extract & analyze real earning/spending data from BGC.   | Live ✅         | Exists in BGC system; proceed with data extraction.         | KK (BGC Ops)                |
| Tokenomics + WhitePaper (iBC/iBTC) | Design token economy using ALPHA Coin behavior data.     | In Progress 🛠 | Draft by Prof. NOTA; presentation scheduled this week.      | Prof. NOTA                  |

| iBC/iBTC Release & Utility         | Launch token with reward, BTC, and governance functions. | Planned 🧪     | Requires deployment design, roadmap, and founder alignment. | All Founders + Team Leaders |

✅ Use this table as a coordination grid for stakeholder assignment and responsibility planning.

## 📊 THE EXECUTION MATRIX – CYCLE

(Original Strategy – 10 July 2025: [Day 1: Simulated Execution Matrix Section](../../../archived-oioi/2025/07/iblooming-web3-meeting-day1.md#-simulated-execution-matrix))

**How to Read:**
- **Progress** → Combines lifecycle stage (`Live`, `Simulation`, `Planning`, `TBD`, `Post-Sim`) with current execution status (`✅ Running`, `🛠 In Progress`, `🧪 Planned`, `🧭 Pending`, `🧠 Not Started`).
- **Est. Duration** → Estimated completion time.
- **Owner(s)** → Responsible lead(s) and key contributors.
- **Notes** → Key context, dependencies, or constraints.

| Pillar | Objective | Progress | Est. Duration | Owner(s) | Notes |
|--------|-----------|----------|---------------|----------|-------|
| **ALPHA Coin System** | Reframe BGC reward system as “ALPHA Coin” behavioral simulation layer. | Live ✅ | ~3 weeks (data extraction & interpretation) | Prof. NOTA, KK | Internal analytical tool, not public; feeds data into iBC/iBTC tokenomics. |
| **Tokenomics & WhitePaper (iBC/iBTC)** | Design token economy using ALPHA Coin behavior data. | In Progress 🛠 | 1–2 months | Prof. NOTA (Lead), KK | Zero financial risk; NFTs used for behavior modeling. |
| └── **Behavioral Analytics (Pre-Release)** | Validate tokenomics & whitepaper assumptions with detailed user behavior simulation. | In Progress 🛠 | 2–4 weeks | Prof. NOTA, Ops, Data Analyst | Use ALPHA Coin data + simulation to stress-test reward, burn, and staking logic before launch. |
| **Web3 Login & Smart Wallet** | Implement unified smart-wallet login (Account Abstraction). | Planned 🧪 | 1–2 months | Mobile Dev, Web3 Engineer | Initiate mobile app integration. |
| **Release iBC/iBTC & Utility** | Launch token with reward, BTC, and governance functions. | Planned 🧪 | 2–3 months | All Founders + Team Leaders | Requires deployment design, roadmap, and founder alignment. |
| └── **Behavioral Analytics (Ongoing)** | Monitor and adjust tokenomics post-launch. | Planned 🧪 | Continuous | Prof. NOTA, Ops, Data Analyst | Track saving, spending, hoarding, and exchange patterns; detect anomalies; inform iteration of staking, rewards, and burn logic. |
| **Cross-App Token Utility** | Enable iBC/iBTC usage across all iBLOOMING & BGC apps. | TBD 🧭 | TBD | Prof. NOTA, Mobile Dev, Web3 Engineer | Requires dev & UX standardization across platforms. |
| **Legal & Compliance Mapping** | Define legal path for public/licensed token launch. | TBD 🧭 | TBD | Legal Advisor, Prof. NOTA, External Consultants | Determines eligibility for market release or partnerships. |

### 🧾 FINAL NOTES

This matrix is a **living strategy map**, not a finalized execution plan, and will evolve as iBLOOMING and BGC transition from simulation to production.

Once the pillars are stabilized:
- Create GitHub repos (frontend/backend/contracts)
- Map milestone roadmaps (v0.1, v0.2, etc.)
- Assign tasks across Tech, Ops, Legal, and Creative
- Keep strategy grounded in behavioral truth, not hype

✅ All matrix updates and field data will be recorded as part of the **living system log**.
