# Understanding Affiliate & Rewards (BGC & iBLOOMING)

## 0. Users in BGC & iBLOOMING

In the BGC & iBLOOMING ecosystem, a **user** is anyone who transacts—whether a one-time purchase, a subscription, or simply a sign-up—and uses or benefits from the ongoing operations of BGC & iBLOOMING. A **user** can be an individual or an organization.

Below are the user types within the BGC & iBLOOMING ecosystem:

| Base Type       | Subtype       | Channel Provider (CP) | Executive CP | WEC User |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------|--------------|----------|
| General User    | —             | ✓                     | ✓            | ✗        |
| Affiliate User  | Pathfinder    | ✓                     | ✓            | ✗        |
| Affiliate User  | Voyager       | ✓                     | ✓            | ✗        |
| Affiliate User  | Explorer      | ✓                     | ✓            | ✗        |

## 1. Affiliate & Entry

Bloo Global Company (BGC) utilizes an **Affiliate Membership** system with 5 levels. Each **Affiliate** level can only be purchased and paid for with fiat (USD). After purchasing and paying with fiat, the **user** officially becomes an **Affiliate User**.

| **Level**  | **Entry Fee (USD)** |
| ---------- | ------------------- |
| Pathfinder | $100                |
| Voyager    | $500                |
| Explorer   | $1,590              |
| Pioneer    | $2,650              |
| Special    | $10,600             |

➡️ **Important Notes:**
- The **Entry Fee** is the fiat on-ramp into the BGC system.
- After paying with fiat, the **Affiliate User** receives **Purchase Credit.**

---

## 2. Purchase Credit (PC)

- Definition: **Purchase Credit** is not only the counterpart of the fiat paid, but also proof of **Affiliate Membership** as well as a credit balance to buy physical products at BGC. It functions like an internal currency for purchasing physical products at BGC.
- Ratio: **100 PC = $1 USD** (fixed, non-volatile).
- Functions:
  - Serves as evidence that BGC sells physical products (MLM legal requirement).
  - Because the **Affiliate User** has received **Purchase Credit**, the company **has no obligation to refund** the fiat paid to BGC.

➡️ Additional Notes:
- At BGC, **Affiliate Membership** cannot be purchased/paid using **Purchase Credit**. **Affiliate Membership** can only be purchased/paid with fiat. In short, within BGC: fiat in → **PC** increases → physical product out → **PC** decreases.

---

## 3. World Executive Club (WEC)

- Definition: A **WEC User** is a status for **Affiliate Users** whose level is **Pioneer** or **Special**, whose accumulated total income based on **Sales Points** in BGC—namely **Referral (RR)** and **Generation Reward (GR)**—within 60 days (starting date set by the **Affiliate User**), has reached $10,000. **WEC User** status is permanent once the threshold is reached within the specified 60 days.
- Level Independence: **WEC User** does not replace the **Affiliate User** level **(Pioneer/Special)**.

        - 2.5% → **CPR** for the **Affiliate User** in the second year and beyond → 2.5% × $30 = **$0.75**
      - 15% → **Global Profit Sharing (GPS)** → 15% × $30 = **$4.5**
      - Remainder → iBLOOMING Profit:
        - 69% → iBLOOMING Profit in the first year → 69% × $30 = **$20.7**
        - 71.5% → iBLOOMING Profit in the second year and beyond → 10% × $30 = **$21.45**

### 6.1 Link Reward (LR)

- Definition: Paid to an **Affiliate User** whenever a user buys a **CP User**'s digital product on iBLOOMING using the **Affiliate User**’s link.
- Rate: 10% of iBLOOMING Revenue of each **CP User**'s digital product purchase.
- Example (For a $100 purchase/transaction):
  - 70% → **CP User** Revenue → 70% × $100 = **$70**
  - 30% → iBLOOMING Revenue → 30% × $100 = **$30**
    - The $30 (100% iBLOOMING Revenue) is then allocated as:
      - 10% → **Link Reward** for the **Affiliate User** → 10% × $30 = **$3**

Payout Frequency: Monthly (aggregate). If, in a month, 100 users each make 3 purchases averaging $100, the **Affiliate User**’s total **Link Reward** is: `100 users × 3 purchases × $100 x 30% x 10% = $900`.

---

### 6.2 Miracle Cash (MC)

- Definition: Paid to **users** (not limited to **Affiliate Users** or **CP Users**). After a **user** buys a **CP User**'s digital product on iBLOOMING, they receive **Miracle Cash** each time another **user** buys a **CP User**'s digital product—capped at 10 subsequent purchases.
- Rate: 1% of iBLOOMING Revenue of each **CP User**'s digital product purchase.
- Example (For a $100 purchase/transaction):
  - 70% → **CP User** Revenue → 70% × $100 = **$70**
  - 30% → iBLOOMING Revenue → 30% × $100 = **$30**
    - The $30 (100% iBLOOMING Revenue) is then allocated as:
      - 1% → **Miracle Cash** for the **user** → 1% × $30 = **$0.3**

Payout Frequency: Monthly (aggregate). If, in a month, a user makes 3 purchases and, after each purchase, there are 10 subsequent purchases by others, each averaging $100, then the **user** total **Miracle Cash** is: `3 self-purchases × 10 subsequent purchases × $100 x 30% x 1% = $9`.

---

### 6.3 Channel Provider Reward (CPR)

- Definition: Paid to an **Affiliate User** who brings a **CP User** into iBLOOMING, when the **CP User**’s digital product is sold/purchased by **users**.
- Rate: 5% of iBLOOMING Revenue in the first year, then 2.5% in the second year and beyond.
- Example (For a $100 purchase/transaction):
  - 70% → **CP User** Revenue → 70% × $100 = **$70**
  - 30% → iBLOOMING Revenue → 30% × $100 = **$30**
    - The $30 (100% iBLOOMING Revenue) is then allocated as:
      - **Channel Provider Reward (CPR):**
        - 5% → **CPR** for the **Affiliate User** in the first year → 5% × $30 = **$1.5**
        - 2.5% → **CPR** for the **Affiliate User** in the second year and beyond → 2.5% × $30 = **$0.75**

- Payout Frequency: Monthly (aggregate), as long as the **CP User**’s digital product continues generating revenue.

---

### 6.4 GiM Referral Reward (GRR)

- Definition: Paid to an **Affiliate User** whenever a **user** signs up for GiM using the **Affiliate User**’s link. The reward is tiered with two pathways: Individual and Organization.
- Rates (per sign-up, same totals for both pathways):
  - Individual Referral: **$3** → First-Tier **Affiliate User**; **$0.8** → Second-Tier **Affiliate User**; **$0.2** → **WEC User**'s Pool (Third-Tier).
  - Organization Referral: **$3** → First-Tier **Organization**; **$0.8** → Second-Tier **Affiliate User**; **$0.2** → **WEC User**'s Pool (Third-Tier).
- **WEC User**'s Pool (Third-Tier) Note: **WEC User** = World Executive Club. The $0.2 Third-Tier amount does not go to a single upline; it is paid into the **WEC User**'s Pool and split equally among all **WEC Users** at payout time.

Payout Frequency: Monthly (aggregated). If there are 100 GiM sign-ups in a month (from any mix of Individual/Organization referrals), the **GRR** then:
- Tier 1 (**Affiliate User**/**Organization**): `$3 x 100 = $300`
- Tier 2 (**Affiliate User**): `$0.8 x 100 = $80`
- Tier 3 (**WEC User**'s Pool): `$0.2 x 100 = $20` → split equally among all **WEC Users** (e.g., 50 **WEC Users** → $0.40 each)

---

### 5.4 iMATRIX Referral Reward (iRR)

- Definition: Paid to an **Affiliate User** whenever a **user** subscribes to iMATRIX via the **Affiliate User**’s link. The reward is tiered with two pathways: Individual and Organization, based on the subscription types.
- Rates (per subscription; same totals for both pathways):
  - **Foundation:** **$0.60** → Tier 1; **$0.25** → Tier 2; **$0.10** → **WEC User**'s Pool (Tier 3)
  - **Pro:** **$5.00** → Tier 1; **$2.50** → Tier 2; **$1.00** → WEC User**'s Pool (Tier 3)
  - **Expert:** **$12.00** → Tier 1; **$5.00** → Tier 2; **$2.00** → WEC User**'s Pool (Tier 3)
- **WEC User**'s Pool (Tier-3) Note: **WEC User** = World Executive Club. The Tier-3 amount does not go to a single upline; it is paid into the **WEC User**'s Pool and split equally among all **WEC Users** at payout time.

Payout Frequency: Monthly (aggregated). If the month has **250 Foundation**, **150 Pro**, and **100 Expert** subscriptions (from any mix of Individual/Organization referrals), then the **iRR** totals are:
- Tier 1 (**Affiliate User**/**Organization**): `($0.60 × 250) + ($5.00 × 150) + ($12.00 × 100) = $150 + $750 + $1,200 = $2,100`
- Tier 2 (**Affiliate User**): `($0.25 × 250) + ($2.50 × 150) + ($5.00 × 100) = $62.50 + $375 + $500 = $937.50`
- Tier 3 (**WEC User**'s Pool): `($0.10 × 250) + ($1.00 × 150) + ($2.00 × 100) = $25 + $150 + $200 = $375` → split equally among all **WEC Users**

---

### 6.6 Global Profit Sharing (GPS)

- Definition: **GPS** is a profit pool from iBLOOMING—including profit sourced from **CP User** digital product sales, GiM sign-ups, and iMATRIX subscriptions—distributed to top-level **Affiliate Users** (**Explorer**, **Pioneer**, **Special**). GPS has three profit sources:

  1) 15% of iBLOOMING revenue from each **CP User** digital product purchase.  
     - Example (for a $100 purchase):  
       - 70% → **CP User** revenue = **$70**  
       - 30% → iBLOOMING revenue = **$30**  
       - From this $30, 15% → **GPS** = **$4.50**
  
  2) **$1** from each GiM sign-up (fixed; goes directly to GPS).  
  3) **$0.10, $1.50, or $3.00** from each iMATRIX subscription (fixed by plan; goes directly to **GPS**).

- Eligible Levels: **Explorer, Pioneer, Special** only.  
  - **Explorer** → **2 shares**  
  - **Pioneer** → **3 shares**  
  - **Special** → **15 shares**

- Payout Frequency: Every 6 months (unlike **LR, MC, GRR, iRR, CPR**, which are monthly).  
  - Illustrative distribution:
    - Eligible Affiliates at payout: **550 Explorer**, **300 Pioneer**, **200 Special**  
      - Total shares = (550 × 2) + (300 × 3) + (200 × 15) = **5,000**
    - **GPS** pool (semiannual):  
      - From **CP User** digital products = **$10M**  
      - From GiM sign-ups = **$15M**  
      - From iMATRIX subscriptions = **$25M**  
      - Total **GPS** = $50M
    - Value per share = $50M ÷ 5,000 = **$10,000**
    - Estimated rewards:  
      - **Explorer** = 2 × $10,000 = **$20,000**  
      - **Pioneer** = 3 × $10,000 = **$30,000**  
      - **Special** = 15 × $10,000 = **$150,000**

➡️ Conclusion: **GPS** is a large-scale, cross-product profit pool (**CP User** digital products, GiM, iMATRIX) distributed semiannually to **Explorer**, **Pioneer**, and **Special**.

---

### 6.7 Global Movement Pool (GMP)

- **Definition:** **GMP** is a monthly activity pool sourced **only** from **GiM** sign-ups and **iMATRIX** subscriptions, distributed to **all WEC Users** and **Executive CP**.

- **Sources (fixed per event):**
  1) **$1** from **each GiM sign-up** (goes directly to GMP).  
  2) **$0.30 / $2.00 / $5.00** from **each iMATRIX subscription** (**Foundation / Pro / Expert**, respectively; goes directly to GMP).

- **Eligible Recipients:** **All WEC Users and Executive CP** present at the **monthly payout snapshot**.  
  - **Distribution rule:** **Equal split per recipient** (unless a different weighting is formally adopted later).

- **Payout Frequency:** **Monthly** (aggregated).  
  **Illustrative distribution:**
  - Monthly activity: **1,000 GiM sign-ups**, **600 Foundation**, **300 Pro**, **100 Expert** iMATRIX subscriptions  
  - **GMP pool total:**  
    `($1 × 1,000) + ($0.30 × 600) + ($2.00 × 300) + ($5.00 × 100)`  
    `= 1,000 + 180 + 600 + 500 = **$2,280**`
  - Eligible headcount at snapshot: **120 WEC Users** + **30 Executive CP** = **150** recipients  
  - **Payout per recipient:** `$2,280 ÷ 150 = **$15.20**`

➡️ **Conclusion:** GMP is a **monthly**, activity-driven pool (GiM + iMATRIX) paid **equally** to the current set of **WEC Users** and **Executive CP** at the payout snapshot.
