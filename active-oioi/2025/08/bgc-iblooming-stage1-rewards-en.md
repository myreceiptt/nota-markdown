## 1. Affiliate & Entry

Bloo Global Company (BGC) uses an **Affiliate Membership** system with five levels. Each **Affiliate** level is purchased **with fiat (USD)**. After payment, the user officially becomes an **Affiliate User**.

| **Level**        | **Entry Fee (USD)** |
|------------------|---------------------|
| Pathfinder User  | $100                |
| Voyager User     | $500                |
| Explorer User    | $1,590              |
| Pioneer User     | $2,650              |
| Special User     | $10,600             |

➡️ **Important:**
- The Entry Fee is the fiat on-ramp into the BGC system.
- After paying fiat, the **Affiliate User** receives **Purchase Credit (PC).**

---

## 2. Purchase Credit (PC)

- **Definition:** Purchase Credit is not only the counterpart of fiat paid, but also the evidence of **Affiliate Membership** and a credit balance to buy **physical products** at **BGC**—functioning like an internal currency **for physical goods**.
- **Ratio:** **100 PC = $1 USD** (fixed, non-volatile).
- **Functions:**
  - Satisfies MLM legal requirements that BGC sells physical products.
  - Because PC is issued, BGC **has no obligation to refund** the fiat paid by the **Affiliate User**.

➡️ **Additional Notes:**
- At **BGC**, **Affiliate Membership cannot be purchased with PC**; entry must be paid in fiat. In short: fiat in → PC credited → physical product out → PC debited.
- At **iBLOOMING**, digital products (CP content), GiM sign-ups, and iMATRIX subscriptions **cannot be purchased with PC**—they are **fiat-only**.

---

## 3. World Executive Club (WEC)

- **Definition:** A **WEC User** is an Affiliate User whose **total MyCash income** (sum of all MyCash Program rewards) in the **last 60 days** **has reached $10,000**. WEC status is **temporary and automatic** once the threshold is met.
- **Level Independence:** WEC **does not replace** the Affiliate level (Pathfinder/Voyager/Explorer/Pioneer/Special). Any Affiliate level **can** become WEC upon reaching the income threshold.

---

## 4. Channel Provider (CP)

At iBLOOMING, besides GiM sign-up and iMATRIX subscriptions, digital products include **content from CP Users** (e-courses, e-books, etc.).

A **CP User** is an individual/organization recruited by an Affiliate User to supply content sold as digital products on iBLOOMING (e-courses, e-books, etc.).

A CP User can become **Executive CP** if, at payout time, their **total MyCash income** in the last 60 days **has reached $10,000**. Executive CP status is **temporary and automatic** when the threshold is reached.

➡️ **Important:** All iBLOOMING products are **fiat-only**. PC cannot be used to purchase iBLOOMING products.

---

## 5. MyCash Program Based on **Rebate** (at iBLOOMING)

Once a user is in the BGC & iBLOOMING ecosystem, they may receive **MyCash (rebate-based) rewards** from iBLOOMING.

Rewards include:

1. **iBLOOMING Link Reward (LR)**
2. **iBLOOMING Miracle Cash (MC)**
3. **iBLOOMING Channel Provider Reward (CPR)**
4. **iBLOOMING GiM Referral Reward (GRR)**
5. **iBLOOMING iMATRIX Referral Reward (iRR)**
6. **iBLOOMING Global Profit Sharing (GPS)**
7. **iBLOOMING Global Movement Pool (GMP)**

---

### 5.1 Link Reward (LR)

- **Definition:** Paid to an **Affiliate User** whenever a user buys a CP digital product on iBLOOMING **using the Affiliate’s link**.
- **Rate:** **10%** of each CP digital product purchase.

**Example** (Transaction $100):
- **Link Reward to Affiliate User → $10**  
- Miracle Cash to the buyer → $1  
- Remainder to iBLOOMING → $89  
  (This makes up 100% of the product revenue that will be aggregated, then distributed under the Channel Provider Reward rules.)

**Payout Frequency:** **Monthly (aggregate).**  
If, in a month, 100 users each make **3** purchases averaging **$100**, the Affiliate’s total LR is: `10% × 100 users × 3 purchases × $100 = $3,000`.

---

### 5.2 Miracle Cash (MC)

- **Definition:** Paid to **any buyer** (not limited to Affiliates or CPs). After a user buys a CP digital product on iBLOOMING, they receive **MC** **each time another user** buys a CP digital product—**capped at 10 subsequent purchases**.
- **Rate:** **1%** of each CP digital product purchase.

**Example** (Transaction $100):
- Link Reward to Affiliate User → $10  
- **Miracle Cash to the buyer → $1**  
- Remainder to iBLOOMING → $89  
  (Aggregated and later split per Channel Provider Reward.)

**Payout Frequency:** **Monthly (aggregate).**  
If a user makes **3 purchases** in a month and, after each purchase, there are **10** subsequent purchases by others, each averaging **$100**, then the buyer’s total **MC** is: `1% × 3 self-purchases × 10 subsequent purchases × $100 = $30`.

---

### 5.3 GiM Referral Reward (GRR)

- **Definition:** Paid to **Affiliates** who refer **new users** to **sign up for GiM** via the Affiliate’s link. This is **tiered** and has **two paths** (Individual and Organization).

**WEC (Third-Tier) Definition**  
**WEC = World Executive Club**, a pool of Affiliates whose **MyCash total income** has reached **$10,000 within 60 days**.  
In **Third-Tier** for GRR, the **$0.2 per sign-up** is **not** paid to a single upline; it goes to the **WEC Pool** and is **split equally among all WEC members**.

- **Rates:**
  - **Individual Referral:** **$3** to Tier 1 (First-Tier Affiliate), **$0.8** to Tier 2 (Second-Tier Affiliate), and **$0.2 to WEC (Third-Tier Pool)**.  
    *Example:* **A** recruits **B** (Affiliate), **B** recruits **C** (Affiliate). When **C** brings a new GiM sign-up, the payout per sign-up is: **C = $3**, **B = $0.8**, **WEC Pool = $0.2** (then shared equally among WEC; **A** does **not** get the $0.2 directly).
  - **Organization Referral:** **$3** to Tier 1 (**Organization** referred by the Affiliate), **$0.8** to Tier 2 (Second-Tier Affiliate), and **$0.2 to WEC (Third-Tier Pool)**.  
    *Example:* **A** (Affiliate) recruits **B** (Affiliate), and **B** refers an **Organization** (e.g., a school/community). When the org’s user signs up for GiM: **Organization = $3**, **B = $0.8**, **WEC Pool = $0.2** (equally shared among all WEC members).

- **Revenue Split per GiM Sign-Up:**
  - **$3** → **Tier 1** (First-Tier Affiliate **or** First-Tier **Organization**)  
  - **$0.8** → **Tier 2** (Second-Tier Affiliate)  
  - **$0.2** → **WEC Pool** (Third-Tier; split equally among WEC members)  
  - **$1** → **Global Profit Sharing (GPS)**  
  - **$1** → **Global Movement Pool (GMP)**  
  - **Remainder** → **iBLOOMING**

**Payout Frequency:** **Monthly (aggregate).**  
**Example:** For **100** GiM sign-ups in a month:  
- **Tier 1** (Affiliate/Organization): `100 × $3 = $300`  
- **Tier 2** (Affiliate): `100 × $0.8 = $80`  
- **WEC Pool** (Tier 3): `100 × $0.2 = $20` → if there are **50** WEC members, each gets **$0.40**

---

### 5.4 iMATRIX Referral Reward (iRR)

- **Definition:** Paid to **Affiliates** who refer **users** to **subscribe to iMATRIX** (a subscription product). Payout depends on the chosen plan (**Foundation, Pro, Expert**) and is **three-tiered**. Applies to **Individual** and **Organization** referral paths.

> **WEC (Tier 3) Note**  
> **WEC = World Executive Club** (MyCash total income ≥ $10,000 within 60 days).  
> Tier-3 amounts **do not** go to a single upline; they go into the **WEC Pool** to be **split equally** among WEC members.

- **Rates:**

**A) Individual Referral**
- **Foundation:** **$0.6** (Tier 1), **$0.25** (Tier 2), **$0.1** (Tier 3 → WEC Pool).  
  *Example:* **A** → **B** → **C** (Affiliates). If **C** brings a Foundation subscriber: **C = $0.6**, **B = $0.25**, **WEC Pool = $0.1**.
- **Pro:** **$5** (Tier 1), **$2.5** (Tier 2), **$1** (Tier 3 → WEC Pool).  
- **Expert:** **$12** (Tier 1), **$5** (Tier 2), **$2** (Tier 3 → WEC Pool).

**B) Organization Referral**
- **Foundation:** **$0.6** (Tier 1 = Organization), **$0.25** (Tier 2 Affiliate), **$0.1** (Tier 3 → WEC Pool).  
- **Pro:** **$5** (Tier 1 = Organization), **$2.5** (Tier 2 Affiliate), **$1** (Tier 3 → WEC Pool).  
- **Expert:** **$12** (Tier 1 = Organization), **$5** (Tier 2 Affiliate), **$2** (Tier 3 → WEC Pool).

- **Revenue Split per Subscription (additional GPS & GMP allocation):**

**Foundation**
- **$0.6** → Tier 1 (First-Tier Affiliate **or** Organization)  
- **$0.25** → Tier 2 (Second-Tier Affiliate)  
- **$0.1** → **WEC Pool (Tier 3)**  
- **$0.1** → **GPS**  
- **$0.3** → **GMP**  
- **Remainder** → **iBLOOMING**

**Pro**
- **$5** → Tier 1 (First-Tier Affiliate **or** Organization)  
- **$2.5** → Tier 2 (Second-Tier Affiliate)  
- **$1** → **WEC Pool (Tier 3)**  
- **$1.5** → **GPS**  
- **$2** → **GMP**  
- **Remainder** → **iBLOOMING**

**Expert**
- **$12** → Tier 1 (First-Tier Affiliate **or** Organization)  
- **$5** → Tier 2 (Second-Tier Affiliate)  
- **$2** → **WEC Pool (Tier 3)**  
- **$3** → **GPS**  
- **$5** → **GMP**  
- **Remainder** → **iBLOOMING**

> *Note:* These are **fixed nominal amounts per subscription event**, **separate** from GPS contributions (avoid double counting). iRR is a direct referral incentive; GPS is a pooled distribution paid every six months.

**Payout Frequency:** **Monthly (aggregate).**  
**Example (monthly totals):** If in one month there are **250 Foundation**, **150 Pro**, and **100 Expert** subscribers:

- **Tier 1 (Affiliate/Organization):**  
  - Foundation: `250 × $0.6 = $150`  
  - Pro: `150 × $5 = $750`  
  - Expert: `100 × $12 = $1,200`  
  - **Total Tier 1 = $2,100**

- **Tier 2 (Affiliate):**  
  - Foundation: `250 × $0.25 = $62.50`  
  - Pro: `150 × $2.5 = $375`  
  - Expert: `100 × $5 = $500`  
  - **Total Tier 2 = $937.50**

- **WEC Pool (Tier 3):**  
  - Foundation: `250 × $0.1 = $25`  
  - Pro: `150 × $1 = $150`  
  - Expert: `100 × $2 = $200`  
  - **Total WEC Pool = $375** → split equally among all WEC members.

### 5.5 Channel Provider Reward (CPR)

- **Definition:** Paid to **Affiliates** who recruit **CPs** into iBLOOMING when the CP’s digital content (e-courses, e-books, etc.) generates revenue.
- **Rate:** **5% in Year 1**, then **2.5% from Year 2 onward**, calculated on **total CP content revenue**.

- **Base Revenue Split (per sale):**  
  - **70%** → **Channel Provider (CP)**  
  - **30%** → **iBLOOMING**

- **Distribution of iBLOOMING’s 30%:**
  - **Year 1**
    - **25%** → iBLOOMING
    - **5%** → Affiliate who recruited the CP
  - **Year 2+**
    - **27.5%** → iBLOOMING
    - **2.5%** → Affiliate who recruited the CP

**Example** (Revenue $100):
- CP → **$70**  
- iBLOOMING (Year 1) → **$25** (**$15** of which is the 15% **GPS** contribution from CP product revenue)  
- Affiliate who recruited CP (Year 1) → **$5**  
- iBLOOMING (Year 2+) → **$27.5** (**$15** goes to **GPS**)  
- Affiliate who recruited CP (Year 2+) → **$2.5**

**Payout Frequency:** **Monthly**, as long as the CP content generates revenue.

---

### 5.6 Global Profit Sharing (GPS)

- **Definition:** **GPS** is a profit pool from **iBLOOMING** (including CP digital product profit, GiM sign-ups, and iMATRIX subscriptions) distributed to **top Affiliate levels**. It has **three sources**:

  1. **15% of CP digital product revenue** (e-courses, e-books, etc.).  
     **Example** (Revenue $100):  
     - CP → $70  
     - **Into GPS** → **$15**  
     - iBLOOMING (Year 1) → $10  
     - CP recruiter (Year 1) → $5  
     - iBLOOMING (Year 2+) → $12.5  
     - CP recruiter (Year 2+) → $2.5

  2. **$1 from each GiM sign-up** (fixed, goes directly to GPS).
  3. **$0.1, $1.5, and $3 from each iMATRIX subscription** (fixed, by plan, goes directly to GPS).

- **Payout Frequency:** **Every 6 months** (unlike LR, MC, GRR, iRR, CPR which are monthly).

- **Eligible Levels:** **Explorer, Pioneer, Special** only.  
  - Explorer → **2 Shares**  
  - Pioneer → **3 Shares**  
  - Special → **15 Shares**

**Example (semiannual distribution):**
- Eligible Affiliates at payout: **550 Explorer**, **300 Pioneer**, **200 Special**  
- **Total Shares** = `(550 × 2) + (300 × 3) + (200 × 15) = 5,000`  
- **GPS Pool:**  
  - CP product profit = **$10M**  
  - GiM sign-up profit = **$15M**  
  - iMATRIX subscription profit = **$25M**  
  - **Total GPS = $50M**  
- **Value per Share** = `$50M ÷ 5,000 = $10,000`  
- **Estimated Rewards:**  
  - Explorer = `2 × $10,000 = $20,000`  
  - Pioneer = `3 × $10,000 = $30,000`  
  - Special = `15 × $10,000 = $150,000`

➡️ **Conclusion:** GPS is a large-scale, cross-product pool (CP content, GiM, iMATRIX) distributed **semiannually** to Explorer, Pioneer, and Special.

### 5.7 Global Movement Pool (GMP)

> **Template — to be finalized**

- **Definition:** A global incentive pool based on **network growth & activity** across iBLOOMING/BGC, paid to Affiliates who meet defined **performance criteria**.
- **Objective:** Reward **healthy growth**: qualified user/CP acquisition, retention, recurring revenue, and compliance.
- **Pool Sources (tentative):**
  - Percentage of combined net revenue? (TBD)
  - Fixed allocation per period? (TBD)
  - Variable component (e.g., global milestones)? (TBD)
- **Eligibility & Weights (tentative):**
  - Minimum thresholds (e.g., referral revenue ≥ T, churn ≤ C, KYC/AML compliance, etc.).
  - **Contribution weights** per dimension (placeholders):
    - Qualified new user acquisition → w₁
    - CP sales (GMV) → w₂
    - Retention (repeat purchases) → w₃
    - Cross-app activation (GiM/iMATRIX) → w₄
- **Generic Formula (placeholder):**
  - `AffiliateScore = w₁·A + w₂·B + w₃·R + w₄·X`
  - `AffiliateShare = AffiliateScore / (Σ Scores of all eligible)`
  - `AffiliatePayout = AffiliateShare × (Total GMP Pool)`
- **Example (after weights/thresholds set):**
  - Suppose Total GMP = **$2,000,000**. Three eligible Affiliates have scores (120, 80, 50) → total **250**.
  - Shares = (120/250, 80/250, 50/250) → payouts = **$960k, $640k, $400k**.
- **Payout Frequency:** Quarterly/Semiannual (to be decided; state clearly if different from GPS).
- **Data Needed:**
  - Pipelines & activity logs (acquisition, revenue, retention, activation), compliance checks.
  - Anti-fraud rules (bots, self-deals, circular trading).

---

## 6. MyCash Program Based on **Sales Point (SP)**

- **Definition:** SP is a weight/unit used to compute rewards and bonus distribution. It remains unclear whether SP applies only to BGC, to iBLOOMING, or to both.
- **Fixed Value:** **1 SP = $1** (equivalent).
- **SP Weight by Level:**
  - Pathfinder → **70 SP**
  - Voyager → **350 SP**
  - Explorer → **1,081 SP**
  - Pioneer → **1,802 SP**
  - Special → **7,210 SP**

➡️ Detailed SP acquisition & distribution mechanics will be elaborated in **Phase 2**.
