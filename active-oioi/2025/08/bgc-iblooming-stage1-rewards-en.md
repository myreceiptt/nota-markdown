# Understanding Affiliate & Rewards (BGC & iBLOOMING) — EN

## 1. Affiliate & Entry

Bloo Global Company (BGC) uses an **Affiliate Membership** system with five levels. Each **Affiliate** level can only be purchased and paid using fiat (USD). After payment is made in fiat, the person officially becomes an **Affiliate**.

| **Level**  | **Entry Fee (USD)** |
| ---------- | ------------------- |
| Pathfinder | $100                |
| Voyager    | $500                |
| Explorer   | $1,590              |
| Pioneer    | $2,650              |
| Special    | $10,600             |

➡️ **Important Note:**

- The Entry Fee is the entry point for fiat money into the BGC system.
- After paying in fiat, the **Affiliate** receives **Purchase Credit (PC)**.

---

## 2. Purchase Credit (PC)

- **Definition:** Purchase Credit is not only a substitute for the fiat already paid, but also proof of **Affiliate Membership** and a credit value to purchase **physical products** in **BGC**. In short, it acts like an internal currency for **physical products** in BGC.
- **Ratio:** 100 PC = $1 USD (fixed, non-volatile).
- **Functions:**
  - Serves as proof that BGC sells physical products (a legal requirement for MLM).
  - Because the Affiliate has received PC, the company **has no obligation to refund the fiat already paid by the Affiliate to BGC**.

➡️ **Additional Note:**

- In **BGC**, **Affiliate Membership** cannot be purchased/paid using PC. Membership can only be purchased with fiat. In BGC the flow is: fiat enters → PC increases → physical products are redeemed → PC decreases.
- In **iBLOOMING**, digital products from Channel Providers (CP), **GiM** sign-ups, and **iMATRIX** subscriptions **cannot** be purchased with PC and **must** be paid in fiat.

---

## 3. MyCash Program Based on **Rebate** (at iBLOOMING)

After becoming an **Affiliate** (paying in fiat + receiving PC), the Affiliate is entitled to rewards from iBLOOMING, called the **MyCash Program**, which consists of:

1. **iBLOOMING Link Reward (LR)**
2. **iBLOOMING Miracle Cash (MC)**
3. **iBLOOMING GiM Referral Reward (GRR)**
4. **iBLOOMING iMATRIX Referral Reward (iRR)**
5. **iBLOOMING Channel Provider Reward (CPR)**
6. **iBLOOMING Global Profit Sharing (GPS)**
7. **iBLOOMING Global Movement Pool (GMP)**

---

### 3.1 Link Reward (LR)

- **Definition:** A reward for **Affiliates** who bring **new users** to iBLOOMING through their affiliate link, where those new users purchase a CP’s digital product (e-course, e-book, etc.) **for the first time**.

- **Amount:** **10%** of the first purchase/transaction value made by the new user who used the Affiliate’s link.

- **Example** (First purchase = $100):
  - iBLOOMING → $90 (this is counted as CP content revenue and will be accumulated, then distributed according to Channel Provider Reward and Global Profit Sharing)
  - Affiliate who brought the new user via link → **$10**

- **Payout Frequency:** **Monthly**, in aggregate. For example, if an Affiliate brings 10 new users to iBLOOMING in a month, each making a first purchase of $100 on average, the total payout for the Affiliate is: 10% × $100 × 10 users = **$100**.

---

### 3.2 Miracle Cash (MC)

- **Definition:** A reward for **Affiliates** who have already brought new users to iBLOOMING via their link, when those users make their **2nd up to 11th** purchases of CP digital products (e-course, e-book, etc.).

- **Amount:** **1%** of each of the 10 purchases **after** the first one, i.e., transactions #2 through #11.

- **Examples:**
  - If a user brought by the Affiliate makes a **second** purchase of **$100**:
    - iBLOOMING → **$99** (counted as CP content revenue and later distributed via CPR & GPS)
    - Affiliate → **$1** (1% × $100)
  - If the **same user** goes on to make **10 additional** purchases (each $100):
    - iBLOOMING → **$990** (accumulated CP content revenue)
    - Affiliate → **$10** (1% × $100 × 10)
  - If **10 users** each make **10 additional** purchases (each $100):
    - iBLOOMING → **$9,900** (accumulated CP content revenue)
    - Affiliate → **$100** (1% × $100 × 10 users × 10 tx)

- **Payout Frequency:** **Monthly**, in aggregate. Example: if an Affiliate in a given month has **10 users** who each make their 2nd–11th purchases (or more) and the average purchase value is $100, then the total Miracle Cash paid to the Affiliate is: 1% × $100 × 10 users × 10 transactions = **$100**.

---

### 3.3 GiM Referral Reward (GRR)

- **Definition:** A reward for **Affiliates** who successfully refer **new users** to sign up for **GiM** through their affiliate link. This reward is **multi-tiered** and has **two paths** (Individual and Organization).

- **Amounts:**

  - **Individual Referral:** $3 for **Tier 1** (First-Tier Affiliate), $0.8 for **Tier 2**, and $0.2 for **Tier 3**.  
    **Example:** **A** recruited **B** (Affiliate), **B** recruited **C** (Affiliate). When **C** brings a user who signs up for **GiM**, per sign-up: **C = $3**, **B = $0.8**, **A = $0.2**.

  - **Organization Referral:** $3 for **Tier 1** (**Organization** as First-Tier), $0.8 for **Tier 2** (Affiliate), and $0.2 for **Tier 3** (Affiliate).  
    **Example:** **A** (Affiliate) recruited **B** (Affiliate). **B** then referred an **Organization** (e.g., school/community). When **the organization’s users** sign up for **GiM**, per sign-up: **Organization = $3**, **B = $0.8**, **A = $0.2**.

- **Revenue Split per GiM Sign-Up:**
  - **$3** → **Tier 1** (First-Tier **Affiliate** or **Organization**)
  - **$0.8** → **Tier 2** (Second-Tier Affiliate)
  - **$0.2** → **Tier 3** (Third-Tier Affiliate)
  - **$1** → pooled for **Global Profit Sharing (GPS)**
  - **$1** → pooled for **Global Movement Pool (GMP)**
  - **Remainder** → **iBLOOMING**

- **Payout Frequency:** **Monthly**, in aggregate.  
  **Example:** If an **Affiliate** or **Organization** has **100 GiM sign-ups** in a month, then GRR totals are:
  - **Tier 1** (Affiliate/Organization): $3 × 100 = **$300**
  - **Tier 2** (Affiliate): $0.8 × 100 = **$80**
  - **Tier 3** (Affiliate): $0.2 × 100 = **$20**

---

### 3.4 iMATRIX Referral Reward (iRR)

- **Definition:** A reward for **Affiliates** who refer **users** to subscribe to **iMATRIX** (a subscription product). Rewards depend on the **subscription tier** chosen by the user (**Foundation, Pro, Expert**) and are **multi-tier**. The scheme applies to two routes: **Individual Referral** and **Organization Referral**.

- **Amounts:**

  **A) Individual Referral**
  - **Foundation:** $0.6 (Tier 1), $0.25 (Tier 2), $0.1 (Tier 3).  
    *Example:* **A** recruited **B** (Affiliate), **B** recruited **C** (Affiliate). When **C** brings a user who subscribes to **Foundation**, per subscription: **C = $0.6**, **B = $0.25**, **A = $0.1**.
  - **Pro:** $5 (Tier 1), $2.5 (Tier 2), $1 (Tier 3).  
    *Example:* Same pattern → **Tier 1 (C) = $5**, **Tier 2 (B) = $2.5**, **Tier 3 (A) = $1** per **Pro** subscription.
  - **Expert:** $12 (Tier 1), $5 (Tier 2), $2 (Tier 3).  
    *Example:* Same pattern → **Tier 1 (C) = $12**, **Tier 2 (B) = $5**, **Tier 3 (A) = $2** per **Expert** subscription.

  **B) Organization Referral**
  - **Foundation:** $0.6 (Tier 1 = **Organization**), $0.25 (Tier 2 Affiliate), $0.1 (Tier 3 Affiliate).  
    *Example:* **A** (Affiliate) recruited **B** (Affiliate); **B** referred an **Organization**. When the organization’s user subscribes to **Foundation**, payout: **Organization = $0.6**, **B = $0.25**, **A = $0.1** per subscription.
  - **Pro:** $5 (Tier 1 = Organization), $2.5 (Tier 2 Affiliate), $1 (Tier 3 Affiliate).  
    *Example:* For **Pro**: **Organization = $5**, **B = $2.5**, **A = $1**.
  - **Expert:** $12 (Tier 1 = Organization), $5 (Tier 2 Affiliate), $2 (Tier 3 Affiliate).  
    *Example:* For **Expert**: **Organization = $12**, **B = $5**, **A = $2**.

- **Revenue Split per Subscription (additional allocation to GPS & GMP):**

  **Foundation**
  - **$0.6** → Tier 1 (First-Tier Affiliate **or** Organization)  
  - **$0.25** → Tier 2 (Second-Tier Affiliate)  
  - **$0.1** → Tier 3 (Third-Tier Affiliate)  
  - **$0.1** → pooled for **Global Profit Sharing (GPS)**  
  - **$0.3** → pooled for **Global Movement Pool (GMP)**  
  - **Remainder** → **iBLOOMING**

  **Pro**
  - **$5** → Tier 1 (First-Tier Affiliate **or** Organization)  
  - **$2.5** → Tier 2 (Second-Tier Affiliate)  
  - **$1** → Tier 3 (Third-Tier Affiliate)  
  - **$1.5** → pooled for **GPS**  
  - **$2** → pooled for **GMP**  
  - **Remainder** → **iBLOOMING**

  **Expert**
  - **$12** → Tier 1 (First-Tier Affiliate **or** Organization)  
  - **$5** → Tier 2 (Second-Tier Affiliate)  
  - **$2** → Tier 3 (Third-Tier Affiliate)  
  - **$3** → pooled for **GPS**  
  - **$5** → pooled for **GMP**  
  - **Remainder** → **iBLOOMING**

> *Note:* The figures above are **fixed amounts per subscription event** and are **separate** from the contribution to **GPS** (avoid double counting with GPS; iRR is a direct referral incentive, while GPS allocation is a separate pool distributed semi-annually).

- **Payout Frequency:** **Monthly**, in aggregate.  
  **Monthly example:** If in a given month there are **250 Foundation**, **150 Pro**, and **100 Expert** subscribers, then iRR payout is:
  - **Tier 1 (Affiliate/Organization):**  
    - Foundation: $0.6 × 250 = **$150**  
    - Pro: $5 × 150 = **$750**  
    - Expert: $12 × 100 = **$1,200**  
    - **Total Tier 1 = $150 + $750 + $1,200 = $2,100**
  - **Tier 2 (Affiliate):**  
    - Foundation: $0.25 × 250 = **$62.5**  
    - Pro: $2.5 × 150 = **$375**  
    - Expert: $5 × 100 = **$500**  
    - **Total Tier 2 = $62.5 + $375 + $500 = $937.5**
  - **Tier 3 (Affiliate):**  
    - Foundation: $0.1 × 250 = **$25**  
    - Pro: $1 × 150 = **$150**  
    - Expert: $2 × 100 = **$200**  
    - **Total Tier 3 = $25 + $150 + $200 = $375**

### 3.5 Channel Provider Reward (CPR)

- **Definition:** A reward for **Affiliates** who bring a **Channel Provider (CP)** to iBLOOMING, when that CP’s digital products (e-course, e-book, etc.) are sold to iBLOOMING users.

- **Amounts:** **5%** in the **1st year**, then **2.5%** in the **2nd year & beyond**, calculated over the accumulated revenue from that CP’s content in iBLOOMING.

- **Revenue Split:**
  - **70%** → **Channel Provider (CP)**
  - **30%** → **iBLOOMING**

- **Distribution of iBLOOMING’s 30%:**
  - **Year 1**
    - **25%** → iBLOOMING
    - **5%** → Affiliate who brought the CP to iBLOOMING
  - **Year 2 & Beyond**
    - **27.5%** → iBLOOMING
    - **2.5%** → Affiliate who brought the CP to iBLOOMING

- **Example** (Revenue = $100):
  - Channel Provider (CP) → **$70**
  - iBLOOMING (Year 1) → **$25** (**$15** or **15% of revenue** is the CP content profit that will be accumulated, then distributed via **Global Profit Sharing**)
  - Affiliate who brought the CP (Year 1) → **$5**
  - iBLOOMING (Year 2+) → **$27.5** (**$15** or **15% of revenue** is accumulated CP content profit for **GPS**)
  - Affiliate who brought the CP (Year 2+) → **$2.5**

- **Payout Frequency:** **Monthly**, as long as the CP’s content keeps generating revenue.

---

### 3.6 Global Profit Sharing (GPS)

- **Definition:** **GPS** is a pooled profit from **iBLOOMING** (including profits from CP content, **GiM** sign-ups, and **iMATRIX** subscriptions) to be distributed to **top-level Affiliates**. **GPS** has three main profit sources:

  1. **15%** of revenue from CP digital products (e-courses, e-books, etc.).
     - **Example** (Revenue = $100):
       - Channel Provider (CP) → **$70**
       - **Into GPS** → **$15**
       - iBLOOMING (Year 1) → **$10**
       - Affiliate who brought the CP (Year 1) → **$5**
       - iBLOOMING (Year 2+) → **$12.5**
       - Affiliate who brought the CP (Year 2+) → **$2.5**
  2. **$1** from every **GiM** paid sign-up (fixed; goes directly into GPS).
  3. **$0.1, $1.5, and $3** from every **iMATRIX** subscription (fixed; goes directly into GPS depending on subscription tier).

- **Payout Frequency:** Every **6 months** (unlike LR, MC, GRR, iRR, and CPR which are monthly).

- **Eligible Levels:** Only the top three Affiliate levels: **Explorer, Pioneer, Special**.
  - Explorer → **2 Shares**
  - Pioneer → **3 Shares**
  - Special → **15 Shares**

- **Semi-Annual Distribution Example:**
  - Number of top-level Affiliates: 550 Explorers, 300 Pioneers, 200 Specials.
  - Total Shares = (550 × 2) + (300 × 3) + (200 × 15) = **5,000 Shares**.
  - GPS Pool:
    - Profit from CP content = **$10,000,000**
    - Profit from GiM sign-ups = **$15,000,000**
    - Profit from iMATRIX subscriptions = **$25,000,000**
    - **Total GPS = $50,000,000**
  - Value per Share = $50,000,000 ÷ 5,000 = **$10,000**
  - Estimated Rewards:
    - Explorer = 2 × $10,000 = **$20,000**
    - Pioneer = 3 × $10,000 = **$30,000**
    - Special = 15 × $10,000 = **$150,000**

➡️ **Conclusion:** GPS is a large-scale reward spanning iBLOOMING products—CP digital content, GiM sign-ups, and iMATRIX subscriptions—granted only to Explorer, Pioneer, and Special levels, with **semi-annual** payouts.

### 3.7 Global Movement Pool (GMP)

> **Template — to be filled**

- **Definition:** A global incentive pool based on **network growth & activity** across the iBLOOMING/BGC ecosystem, distributed to Affiliates who meet specific **performance criteria**.
- **Purpose:** To reward contributions that drive **healthy growth**: quality user/CP acquisition, retention, recurring revenue, and compliance.
- **Pool Sources (tentative, to finalize):**
  - A percentage of combined net revenue? (TBD)
  - A fixed allocation per period? (TBD)
  - Variable components (e.g., global milestones)? (TBD)
- **Eligibility & Weights (tentative):**
  - Minimum thresholds (e.g., referral revenue ≥ T, churn ≤ C, KYC/AML compliance, etc.).
  - **Contribution weights** per dimension (placeholder):
    - Quality new-user acquisition → **w₁**
    - CP sales (revenue) → **w₂**
    - Retention (repeat purchases) → **w₃**
    - Cross-app activation (GiM/iMATRIX) → **w₄**
- **General Formula (placeholder):**
  - `Affiliate_Score = w₁·A + w₂·B + w₃·R + w₄·X`
  - `Affiliate_Share = Affiliate_Score / (Σ Scores of all eligible)`
  - `Affiliate_Payout = Affiliate_Share × (Total GMP Pool)`
- **Example (after weights/thresholds are defined):**
  - Suppose Total GMP = **$2,000,000**. Three eligible affiliates have scores (120, 80, 50) → total 250.
  - Shares = (120/250, 80/250, 50/250) → payouts = (**$960k**, **$640k**, **$400k**).
- **Payout Frequency:** Quarterly/Semi-annual (TBD; set differently from GPS if desired).
- **Data Needed:**
  - Activity logs & pipelines (acquisition, revenue, retention, activation), compliance.
  - Audit & anti-fraud rules (bots, self-dealing, circular trading).

---

## 4. MyCash Program Based on **Sales Point (SP)**

- **Definition:** SP is a weight/metric used to calculate rewards and bonus distribution. It is still unclear whether SP applies only in BGC, only in iBLOOMING, or both.
- **Fixed Value:** 1 SP = **$1** (equivalent).
- **SP Weight per Level:**
  - Pathfinder → **70 SP**
  - Voyager → **350 SP**
  - Explorer → **1,081 SP**
  - Pioneer → **1,802 SP**
  - Special → **7,210 SP**

➡️ Details of SP accrual & distribution will be unpacked in **Stage 2**.
