## 1. Affiliate & Entry

Bloo Global Company (BGC) uses an **Affiliate Membership** system with five levels. Each **Affiliate** level is purchased **with fiat (USD)**. After payment, the user officially becomes an **Affiliate User**.

| **Level**        | **Entry Fee (USD)** |
|------------------|---------------------|
| Pathfinder User  | $100                |
| Voyager User     | $500                |
| Explorer User    | $1,725              |
| Pioneer User     | $2,875              |
| Special User     | $11,500             |

➡️ **Important:**
- The Entry Fee is the fiat on-ramp into the BGC system.
- After paying fiat, the **Affiliate User** receives **Purchase Credit (PC).**

---

## 2. Purchase Credit (PC)

- **Definition:** Purchase Credit is not only the counterpart of fiat paid, but also the evidence of **Affiliate Membership** and a credit balance to buy **physical products** at **BGC**—functioning like an internal currency **for physical goods**.
- **Ratio:** **100 PC = $1 USD** (fixed, non-volatile).
- **Functions:**
  - Satisfies MLM legal requirements that BGC sells physical products.
  - Because PC is issued, BGC **has no obligation to refund** the fiat paid by the **Affiliate User**.

➡️ **Additional Notes:**
- At **BGC**, **Affiliate Membership cannot be purchased with PC**; entry must be paid in fiat. In short: fiat in → PC credited → physical product out → PC debited.
- At **iBLOOMING**, digital products (CP content), GiM sign-ups, and iMATRIX subscriptions **cannot be purchased with PC**—they are **fiat-only**.

---

## 3. World Executive Club (WEC)

- **Definition:** A **WEC User** is an Affiliate User whose **total MyCash income** (sum of all MyCash Program based on Sales Point, that is RR and GR rewards) in the **60 days** (the starting day set by the Affiliate user itself) **has reached $10,000**. WEC status is **permanent** once the threshold is met within the 60 days.
- **Level Independence:** WEC **does not replace** the Affiliate level (Pioneer/Special).

---

## 4. Channel Provider (CP)

At iBLOOMING, besides GiM sign-up and iMATRIX subscriptions, digital products include **content from CP Users** (e-courses, e-books, etc.).

A **CP User** is an individual/organization recruited by an Affiliate User to supply content sold as digital products on iBLOOMING (e-courses, e-books, etc.).

A CP User can become **Executive CP** if, at payout time, their **total Rewards income** (sum of all Rewards Program based on Rebate in iBlooming) in their best 60 days **has reached $10,000**. Executive CP status is **permanent** when the threshold is reached in their best 60 days.

➡️ **Important:** All iBLOOMING products are **fiat-only**. PC cannot be used to purchase iBLOOMING products.

---

## 5. Reward Program Based on **Rebate** in iBLOOMING

Once a user is in the BGC & iBLOOMING ecosystem, they may receive **Rewards Program (rebate-based)** from iBLOOMING.

Rewards include:

1. **iBLOOMING Link Reward (LR)**
2. **iBLOOMING Miracle Cash (MC)**
3. **iBLOOMING Channel Provider Reward (CPR)**
4. **iBLOOMING GiM Referral Reward (GRR)**
5. **iBLOOMING iMATRIX Referral Reward (iRR)**
6. **iBLOOMING Global Profit Sharing (GPS)**
7. **iBLOOMING Global Movement Pool (GMP)**

---

### 5.1 Link Reward (LR)

- **Definition:** Paid to an **Affiliate User** whenever a user buys a CP digital product on iBLOOMING **using the Affiliate’s link**.
- **Rate:** **10%** of each CP digital product purchase.

**Example** (Transaction $100):
- CP user revenue → 70% → $70
- **iBLOOMING revenue** → 30% → $30
  - **Link Reward to Affiliate User → $3**  
  - Miracle Cash to the buyer → $0.3  
  - Remaining to iBLOOMING → $26.7  
    (This makes up 100% of the product revenue that will be aggregated, then distributed under the Channel Provider Reward rules.)

**Payout Frequency:** **Monthly (aggregate).**  
If, in a month, 100 users each make **3** purchases averaging **$100**, the Affiliate’s total LR is: `10% × 100 users × 3 purchases × (30% x $100) = $900`.

---

### 5.2 Miracle Cash (MC)

- **Definition:** Paid to **any buyer** (not limited to Affiliates or CPs). After a user buys a CP digital product on iBLOOMING, they receive **MC** **each time another user** buys a CP digital product—**capped at 10 subsequent purchases**.
- **Rate:** **1%** of each CP digital product purchase.

**Example** (Transaction $100):
- Link Reward to Affiliate User → $10  
- **Miracle Cash to the buyer → $1**  
- Remainder to iBLOOMING → $89  
  (Aggregated and later split per Channel Provider Reward.)

**Payout Frequency:** **Monthly (aggregate).**  
If a user makes **3 purchases** in a month and, after each purchase, there are **10** subsequent purchases by others, each averaging **$100**, then the buyer’s total **MC** is: `1% × 3 self-purchases × 10 subsequent purchases × $100 = $30`.

---

### 5.3 Channel Provider Reward (CPR)

- **Definition:** A reward for an **Affiliate** user who brings a **CP user** into iBLOOMING when the CP user’s digital content is sold/purchased by users.
- **Rate:** **5% in the first year**, then **2.5% from the second year onward**, calculated from iBLOOMING’s share of the revenue split for the CP user’s digital content.
- **Revenue Split:**
  - 70% → **CP user revenue**
  - 30% → **iBLOOMING revenue**
- **Distribution of iBLOOMING Revenue:**
  - **Year 1**
    - 95% → **iBLOOMING profit**
    - 5% → **CPR for the Affiliate user**
  - **Year 2 & beyond**
    - 97.5% → **iBLOOMING profit**
    - 2.5% → **CPR for the Affiliate user**

**Example** (Purchase/Transaction of $100):
- Link Reward to the Affiliate user → 10% × $100 = **$10**
- Miracle Cash to the buyer → 1% × $100 = **$1**
- Remainder to iBLOOMING’s split base → 89% × $100 = **$89**
  - Revenue split on the $89:
    - **CP user revenue → 70% × $89 = $62.30**
    - **iBLOOMING revenue → 30% × $89 = $26.70**
      - **Year 1:**
        - iBLOOMING profit → 95% × $26.70 = **$25.365**  
          This amount counts as **100% of the CP digital product profit** and will be accumulated, then distributed according to **Global Profit Sharing** rules.
        - **CPR for the Affiliate user → 5% × $26.70 = $1.335**
      - **Year 2 & beyond:**
        - iBLOOMING profit → 97.5% × $26.70 = **$26.0325**  
          This amount counts as **100% of the CP digital product profit** and will be accumulated, then distributed according to **Global Profit Sharing** rules.
        - **CPR for the Affiliate user → 2.5% × $26.70 = $0.6675**

- **Payout Frequency:** **Monthly**, as long as the CP user’s digital content continues generating revenue.

---

### 5.4 GiM Referral Reward (GRR)

- **Definition:** A reward for **Affiliate** users paid whenever a user **signs up for GiM** using the Affiliate’s link. This reward is **tiered** and has **two pathways** (Individual and Organization).

- **Rates:**
  - **Individual Referral:**
    - $3 for Tier 1 (First-Tier Affiliate),
    - $0.8 for Tier 2 (Second-Tier Affiliate),
    - and **$0.2 for the WEC User Pool (Third-Tier Pool)**.
    - *Example:*
      - **A** (Affiliate) recruits **B** (Affiliate), then **B** recruits **C** (Affiliate).
      - When **C** brings a user who signs up for **GiM**, the payout per GiM sign-up is:
        - **$3 → C**,
        - **$0.8 → B**,
        - **$0.2 → WEC User Pool**, which is then **split equally** among all WEC users, including **A** if **A** holds WEC status at that time.

  - **Organization Referral:**
    - $3 for Tier 1 (**First-Tier** is the **Organization** referred by the Affiliate),
    - $0.8 for Tier 2 (Second-Tier Affiliate),
    - and **$0.2 for the WEC User Pool (Third-Tier Pool)**.
    - *Example:*
      - **A** (Affiliate) recruits **B** (Affiliate), then **B** refers an **Organization** (e.g., a school/community).
      - When the Organization’s user signs up for **GiM**, the payout per GiM sign-up is:
        - **$3 → Organization**,
        - **$0.8 → B**,
        - **$0.2 → WEC User Pool**, which is then **split equally** among all WEC users at that time.

- **Revenue Split per GiM Sign-Up:**
  - **$3** → **Tier 1** (First-Tier Affiliate **or** First-Tier **Organization**)
  - **$0.8** → **Tier 2** (Second-Tier Affiliate)
  - **$0.2** → **WEC User Pool** (**Third-Tier Pool**, split equally among all WEC users)
  - **$1** → accumulated for **Global Profit Sharing (GPS)**
  - **$1** → accumulated for **Global Movement Pool (GMP)**
  - **$0.2** → accumulated for **Global Executive Committee (GEC)**
  - **Remainder** → **iBLOOMING revenue**

**Payout Frequency:** Paid **monthly** on an aggregate basis. For example, if there are **100 GiM sign-ups** in the month, total GRR payouts are:
- **Tier 1** (Affiliate/Organization): $3 × 100 sign-ups = **$300**
- **Tier 2** (Affiliate): $0.8 × 100 sign-ups = **$80**
- **Tier 3** (WEC User Pool): $0.2 × 100 sign-ups = **$20** → then **split equally** among **all WEC users** (e.g., if there are 50 WEC users → **$0.40** each)

---

### 5.4 iMATRIX Referral Reward (iRR)

- **Definition:** Paid to **Affiliates** who refer **users** to **subscribe to iMATRIX** (a subscription product). Payout depends on the chosen plan (**Foundation, Pro, Expert**) and is **three-tiered**. Applies to **Individual** and **Organization** referral paths.

> **WEC (Tier 3) Note**  
> **WEC = World Executive Club** (MyCash total income ≥ $10,000 within 60 days).  
> Tier-3 amounts **do not** go to a single upline; they go into the **WEC Pool** to be **split equally** among WEC members.

- **Rates:**

**A) Individual Referral**
- **Foundation:** **$0.6** (Tier 1), **$0.25** (Tier 2), **$0.1** (Tier 3 → WEC Pool).  
  *Example:* **A** → **B** → **C** (Affiliates). If **C** brings a Foundation subscriber: **C = $0.6**, **B = $0.25**, **WEC Pool = $0.1**.
- **Pro:** **$5** (Tier 1), **$2.5** (Tier 2), **$1** (Tier 3 → WEC Pool).  
- **Expert:** **$12** (Tier 1), **$5** (Tier 2), **$2** (Tier 3 → WEC Pool).

**B) Organization Referral**
- **Foundation:** **$0.6** (Tier 1 = Organization), **$0.25** (Tier 2 Affiliate), **$0.1** (Tier 3 → WEC Pool).  
- **Pro:** **$5** (Tier 1 = Organization), **$2.5** (Tier 2 Affiliate), **$1** (Tier 3 → WEC Pool).  
- **Expert:** **$12** (Tier 1 = Organization), **$5** (Tier 2 Affiliate), **$2** (Tier 3 → WEC Pool).

- **Revenue Split per Subscription (additional GPS & GMP allocation):**

**Foundation**
- **$0.6** → Tier 1 (First-Tier Affiliate **or** Organization)  
- **$0.25** → Tier 2 (Second-Tier Affiliate)  
- **$0.1** → **WEC Pool (Tier 3)**  
- **$0.1** → **GPS**  
- **$0.3** → **GMP**  
- **Remainder** → **iBLOOMING**

**Pro**
- **$5** → Tier 1 (First-Tier Affiliate **or** Organization)  
- **$2.5** → Tier 2 (Second-Tier Affiliate)  
- **$1** → **WEC Pool (Tier 3)**  
- **$1.5** → **GPS**  
- **$2** → **GMP**  
- **Remainder** → **iBLOOMING**

**Expert**
- **$12** → Tier 1 (First-Tier Affiliate **or** Organization)  
- **$5** → Tier 2 (Second-Tier Affiliate)  
- **$2** → **WEC Pool (Tier 3)**  
- **$3** → **GPS**  
- **$5** → **GMP**  
- **Remainder** → **iBLOOMING**

> *Note:* These are **fixed nominal amounts per subscription event**, **separate** from GPS contributions (avoid double counting). iRR is a direct referral incentive; GPS is a pooled distribution paid every six months.

**Payout Frequency:** **Monthly (aggregate).**  
**Example (monthly totals):** If in one month there are **250 Foundation**, **150 Pro**, and **100 Expert** subscribers:

- **Tier 1 (Affiliate/Organization):**  
  - Foundation: `250 × $0.6 = $150`  
  - Pro: `150 × $5 = $750`  
  - Expert: `100 × $12 = $1,200`  
  - **Total Tier 1 = $2,100**

- **Tier 2 (Affiliate):**  
  - Foundation: `250 × $0.25 = $62.50`  
  - Pro: `150 × $2.5 = $375`  
  - Expert: `100 × $5 = $500`  
  - **Total Tier 2 = $937.50**

- **WEC Pool (Tier 3):**  
  - Foundation: `250 × $0.1 = $25`  
  - Pro: `150 × $1 = $150`  
  - Expert: `100 × $2 = $200`  
  - **Total WEC Pool = $375** → split equally among all WEC members.

---

### 5.5 Channel Provider Reward (CPR)

- **Definition:** Paid to **Affiliates** who recruit **CPs** into iBLOOMING when the CP’s digital content (e-courses, e-books, etc.) generates revenue.
- **Rate:** **5% in Year 1**, then **2.5% from Year 2 onward**, calculated on **total CP content revenue**.

- **Base Revenue Split (per sale):**  
  - **70%** → **Channel Provider (CP)**  
  - **30%** → **iBLOOMING**

- **Distribution of iBLOOMING’s 30%:**
  - **Year 1**
    - **25%** → iBLOOMING
    - **5%** → Affiliate who recruited the CP
  - **Year 2+**
    - **27.5%** → iBLOOMING
    - **2.5%** → Affiliate who recruited the CP

**Example** (Revenue $100):
- CP → **$70**  
- iBLOOMING (Year 1) → **$25** (**$15** of which is the 15% **GPS** contribution from CP product revenue)  
- Affiliate who recruited CP (Year 1) → **$5**  
- iBLOOMING (Year 2+) → **$27.5** (**$15** goes to **GPS**)  
- Affiliate who recruited CP (Year 2+) → **$2.5**

**Payout Frequency:** **Monthly**, as long as the CP content generates revenue.

---

### 5.6 Global Profit Sharing (GPS)

- **Definition:** **GPS** is a profit pool from **iBLOOMING** (including CP digital product profit, GiM sign-ups, and iMATRIX subscriptions) distributed to **top Affiliate levels**. It has **three sources**:

  1. **15% of CP digital product revenue** (e-courses, e-books, etc.).  
     **Example** (Revenue $100):  
     - CP → $70  
     - **Into GPS** → **$15**  
     - iBLOOMING (Year 1) → $10  
     - CP recruiter (Year 1) → $5  
     - iBLOOMING (Year 2+) → $12.5  
     - CP recruiter (Year 2+) → $2.5

  2. **$1 from each GiM sign-up** (fixed, goes directly to GPS).
  3. **$0.1, $1.5, and $3 from each iMATRIX subscription** (fixed, by plan, goes directly to GPS).

- **Payout Frequency:** **Every 6 months** (unlike LR, MC, GRR, iRR, CPR which are monthly).

- **Eligible Levels:** **Explorer, Pioneer, Special** only.  
  - Explorer → **2 Shares**  
  - Pioneer → **3 Shares**  
  - Special → **15 Shares**

**Example (semiannual distribution):**
- Eligible Affiliates at payout: **550 Explorer**, **300 Pioneer**, **200 Special**  
- **Total Shares** = `(550 × 2) + (300 × 3) + (200 × 15) = 5,000`  
- **GPS Pool:**  
  - CP product profit = **$10M**  
  - GiM sign-up profit = **$15M**  
  - iMATRIX subscription profit = **$25M**  
  - **Total GPS = $50M**  
- **Value per Share** = `$50M ÷ 5,000 = $10,000`  
- **Estimated Rewards:**  
  - Explorer = `2 × $10,000 = $20,000`  
  - Pioneer = `3 × $10,000 = $30,000`  
  - Special = `15 × $10,000 = $150,000`

➡️ **Conclusion:** GPS is a large-scale, cross-product pool (CP content, GiM, iMATRIX) distributed **semiannually** to Explorer, Pioneer, and Special.

### 5.7 Global Movement Pool (GMP)

> **Template — to be finalized**

- **Definition:** A global incentive pool based on **network growth & activity** across iBLOOMING/BGC, paid to Affiliates who meet defined **performance criteria**.
- **Objective:** Reward **healthy growth**: qualified user/CP acquisition, retention, recurring revenue, and compliance.
- **Pool Sources (tentative):**
  - Percentage of combined net revenue? (TBD)
  - Fixed allocation per period? (TBD)
  - Variable component (e.g., global milestones)? (TBD)
- **Eligibility & Weights (tentative):**
  - Minimum thresholds (e.g., referral revenue ≥ T, churn ≤ C, KYC/AML compliance, etc.).
  - **Contribution weights** per dimension (placeholders):
    - Qualified new user acquisition → w₁
    - CP sales (GMV) → w₂
    - Retention (repeat purchases) → w₃
    - Cross-app activation (GiM/iMATRIX) → w₄
- **Generic Formula (placeholder):**
  - `AffiliateScore = w₁·A + w₂·B + w₃·R + w₄·X`
  - `AffiliateShare = AffiliateScore / (Σ Scores of all eligible)`
  - `AffiliatePayout = AffiliateShare × (Total GMP Pool)`
- **Example (after weights/thresholds set):**
  - Suppose Total GMP = **$2,000,000**. Three eligible Affiliates have scores (120, 80, 50) → total **250**.
  - Shares = (120/250, 80/250, 50/250) → payouts = **$960k, $640k, $400k**.
- **Payout Frequency:** Quarterly/Semiannual (to be decided; state clearly if different from GPS).
- **Data Needed:**
  - Pipelines & activity logs (acquisition, revenue, retention, activation), compliance checks.
  - Anti-fraud rules (bots, self-deals, circular trading).

---

## 6. MyCash Program Based on **Sales Point (SP)**

- **Definition:** SP is a weight/unit used to compute rewards and bonus distribution. It remains unclear whether SP applies only to BGC, to iBLOOMING, or to both.
- **Fixed Value:** **1 SP = $1** (equivalent).
- **SP Weight by Level:**
  - Pathfinder → **70 SP**
  - Voyager → **350 SP**
  - Explorer → **1,081 SP**
  - Pioneer → **1,802 SP**
  - Special → **7,210 SP**

➡️ Detailed SP acquisition & distribution mechanics will be elaborated in **Phase 2**.
