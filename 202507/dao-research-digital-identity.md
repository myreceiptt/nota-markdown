# Governance Begins with Identity: Exploring DAO Models with ERC-725/735 Identity Layers

## Executive Summary

Most DAO structures today suffer from **Sybil attacks, shallow voting participation, and poor reputation systems**. Without a reliable identity framework, DAO governance remains vulnerable and often dominated by whales or spam.

This paper investigates how integrating **ERC-725 (identity key-value)** and **ERC-735 (claim registry)** into DAO logic can **enable reputation-based voting, role delegation, contributor proofing, and fraud mitigation**.

## Identity in DAO: The Missing Layer

DAOs typically treat every wallet as equal, but not every wallet represents a human, contributor, or expert. Identity-aware governance allows:

- **Weighted voting** based on proven reputation
- **Contributor verification** before funding proposals
- **Role-based participation** across DAO workstreams

## Proposed DAO Identity Architecture

| Component | Role |
|----------|------|
| **ERC-725 Identity Object** | Stores metadata (role, join date, participation tier) |
| **ERC-735 Claim Layer** | Verifies claims (e.g., "voted in 5 proposals", "moderator for 3 months") |
| **Soulbound ID NFTs** | Represent non-transferable DAO roles or memberships |
| **Reputation Oracle** | Calculates scores based on verifiable on-chain activity |

---

## Benefits for DAO Operations

1. **Sybil-Resistant Voting**  
   → One person = one verified ID = weighted participation

2. **Contributor Funding DAO**  
   → Only wallets with verified contributor roles can submit/request funds

3. **Moderation + Access Control**  
   → DAO tooling unlocks or gates permissions based on verified role NFTs

4. **DAO-to-DAO Diplomacy**  
   → Identity NFTs allow reputation bridging between DAOs

## Implementation Challenges

| Challenge | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| Privacy of identity data | Use selective encryption + zero knowledge |
| Claim authenticity | Use DAO-trusted verifiers & claim registries |
| Onboarding friction | Gamify identity setup via minting ceremonies |

## iBLOOMING Case Insight

The iBLOOMING ecosystem has initiated early-stage integration of identity logic via loyalty and profile NFTs. By evolving these into **ERC-725/735 compliant NFTs**, iBLOOMING could become a blueprint for **educational DAOs** with structured governance and verifiable credentials.

## Conclusion

Decentralized governance requires more than tokens — it requires **identity and reputation**. ERC-725 and ERC-735 offer a foundational layer for DAOs to **govern more wisely**, include more fairly, and evolve more securely.
