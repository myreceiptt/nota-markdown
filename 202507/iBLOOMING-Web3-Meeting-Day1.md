## üß≠ Opening Atmosphere

Upon arrival at iBLOOMING HQ, Prof. NOTA was warmly welcomed by the staff ‚Äî some familiar, some newly introduced. The five Founders arrived one by one, greeting Prof. NOTA with genuine warmth, handshakes, and brief embraces, reflecting a deep mutual respect built over time.

The group moved into a dedicated meeting room prepared for this focused session. Janet ‚Äî a long-standing collaborator with Prof. NOTA ‚Äî joined as the mental support for Prof. NOTA and can also serve as a bridge between ideas, actions, and follow-up alignment in the creative field.

## üß© Presentation by Prof. NOTA: Web3 Integration Draft

Prof. NOTA was invited to begin the meeting by presenting and narrating the **Web3 Integration Draft** that had been previously shared.

Rather than reading the document line by line, Prof. NOTA focused on storytelling and real-world examples to bring the proposed components to life.

### ‚úÖ Part 1 ‚Äî Web3 Login System

**Key Points Presented:**
- One wallet per user, integrated across all iBLOOMING platforms (starting with the Mobile App).
- Built using ThirdWeb In-App and Smart Wallet SDK.
- Enables seamless, non-technical access to Web3.

**Response:**
- All five Founders responded positively.
- No objections or questions raised.
- Founders encouraged Prof. NOTA to move forward to the next section.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Part 2 ‚Äî ALPHA Coin: Simulation Phase

**Key Points Presented:**
- ALPHA Coin functions like ‚ÄúLorem Ipsum‚Äù in UI: a placeholder to simulate user behavior.
- The purpose is to track how users **earn**, **save**, and **spend**, to design sustainable tokenomics for the eventual iBLOOMING Coin.

**Discussion Triggered:**
- **Yuku (Founder, Technology)** asked whether ALPHA Coin and iBLOOMING Coin would coexist as separate tokens.
- Prof. NOTA clarified:  
  > ‚ÄúALPHA Coin is not a real token meant to circulate permanently ‚Äî it‚Äôs a simulation phase. Like dummy content in UI, it helps us learn from behavior before designing something real and sustainable.‚Äù

**Interruption:**
- Due to internal distractions, Prof. NOTA faced a little difficulty clearly explaining the **Saving vs. Spending Ratio Table**.

---

### üìò Clarification of ALPHA Coin Simulation Logic

To reiterate for clarity:

| User Type         | Save Ratio | Spend Ratio | Notes                                                  |
|-------------------|------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Regular Learner   | 20%        | 80%         | Uses coins to unlock content                          |
| Active Affiliate  | 40%        | 60%         | Rewards team or community                             |
| Content Creator   | 60%        | 40%         | Saves coins for governance or reinvestment use cases  |

This table is a **simulation framework**, not a fixed rule. It helps iBLOOMING observe behavior before finalizing tokenomics.

### üî∂ Part 3 ‚Äî Bitcoin Pairing + iBLOOMING Coin Vision

**Key Narrative:**
Prof. NOTA explained ‚Äî in practical, everyday language ‚Äî how **Bitcoin holders** and **crypto users** want to:
- Maximize the value of their holdings
- Earn passive interest (like DeFi liquidity staking)
- Use their assets for meaningful, real-life utility

**Strategic Insight:**
> iBLOOMING Coin has the potential to **compete with existing liquidity staking platforms** by offering real-world utility, not just yield.

**Proposed Utility:**
- Access to digital education products
- Participate in the affiliate ecosystem (via BLOO Global)
- Purchase partner services (e.g., data and airtime from Indosat)
- Store BTC-backed value inside the platform

**User Journey (as envisioned by Prof. NOTA):**

```
[1] The user has Bitcoin or crypto
     ‚Üì
[2] Enters the iBLOOMING platform
     ‚Üì
[3] Converts BTC ‚Üí iBLOOMING Coin (BTC-backed)
     ‚Üì
[4] Uses Coin to:
     - Buy content
     - Join the affiliate program
     - Redeem for services (e.g., Indosat)
     - Stake or save
```

Founders listened intently, nodding in agreement, occasionally confused, but provoked by new and exciting possibilities.

## üõ† Prof. NOTA‚Äôs Implementation Framework (Shared at End of Day)

**Objective:**  
Move from vision to action. Identify:
- What needs to be done
- Who will do it
- What‚Äôs continuous vs. one-time

|------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Web3 Login Implementation   | Enable a unified wallet login system across iBLOOMING apps, starting with Mobile. |
| 2    | ALPHA Coin Distributes      | Simulate earning & spending, generate data.                                       |
| 3    | Tokenomics Development      | Use ALPHA Coin behavior data to design a real token economy.                      |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This matrix is a **simulation** based on current understanding. The final role assignment and timeline should be confirmed with the Founders based on real team capacity and rhythms.

## ü™ú Next Step (Suggested by Prof. NOTA)

1. Validate the 4 execution pillars with all Founders  
2. Assign responsible persons and timelines  
3. Begin Phase 1 implementation: **Web3 Login + ALPHA Coin setup**  
4. Observe user behavior, process data, and design final tokenomics  
5. Release iBLOOMING Coin into the ecosystem with real utility
