# iBLOOMING Web3 – Living Document

This is the synchronized operational document for the Web3 transformation of iBLOOMING & BGC. It summarizes insights, confirms milestones, and instructs concrete next steps after meetings on July 10 and 11, 2025.

## 📌 CURRENT STATUS: Alpha Coin

**Alpha Coin is already in action** within BGC:

- Purchase Credit = Value Token
- Sales Point = Activity Token / Reward Point
- Profit Sharing = Holding-Based Reward
- Integration with iBLOOMING = Cross-App Token Utility

🎯 Alpha Coin is *not a new invention*. It is a **relabeling of existing operational value** in the BGC system. The last two years have effectively been a **live simulation of tokenomics**.

## 🧱 THE 4 EXECUTION PILLARS – STATUS

| Pillar                   | Status             | Explanation                                                                 |
|--------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Web3 Login               | 🔜 Next Phase       | Will begin from the Mobile App (iBLOOMING App). Requires team allocation.   |
| ALPHA Coin               | ✅ Already Running  | Realized through BGC’s internal systems (Purchase Credit, etc).             |
| Tokenomics Development   | 🔄 In Progress      | Use historical BGC/iBLOOMING data to formulate proper ratios and sinks.     |
| iBLOOMING Coin Release   | 🧪 Under Design     | iBC to replace fiat subtly, with Web3 backend logic across all platforms.   |

## 📊 SIMULATED EXECUTION MATRIX – UPDATE

Still serves as a **baseline tool** to:

- Plan timelines
- Estimate resource needs
- Assign stakeholders

🔄 Will evolve into: **`Token-Flow-Map.md`**

## 🔜 NEXT STEPS (Approved)

| Step | Description | Output |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Update Draft Tokenomics & WhitePaper iBLOOMING Coin | `iBLOOMING-Coin-WhitePaper-Draft.md` |
| 2 | Map Token Flow in BGC & iBLOOMING Ecosystem | `Token-Flow-Map.md` |
| 3 | Prepare Phase 1 Implementation Plan | `Phase1-Implementation-Checklist.md` |
| 4 | Internal Distribution & Founder Sync | Short Message:<br>_"This is the token architecture we’ve been running for 2 years — nothing is new, only elevated."_ |

---

## ✍️ REMINDER: FOCUS & CLARITY

- We are **not pivoting**, we are documenting and elevating.
- Avoid FOMO or over-engineering.
- Everything is already working — we’re just upgrading the rails.
