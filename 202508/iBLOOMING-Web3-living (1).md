# Living Document of Web3 Transformation Guidance

üìç *This document serves as the operational and strategic guide for the Web3 transformation of iBLOOMING & BGC, based on collective discussions held on July 10 & 11, 2025.*

It consolidates insights, confirms milestones, and instructs next steps following the meetings on:

- [üìÑ Day 1: 10 July 2025](https://github.com/myreceiptt/nota-markdown/blob/main/202507/iBLOOMING-Web3-Meeting-Day1.md)
- [üìÑ Day 2: 11 July 2025](https://github.com/myreceiptt/nota-markdown/blob/main/202508/iBLOOMING-Web3-Meeting-Day2.md)

It is meant to be always read, discussed, adjusted if needed, and agreed upon by all founders ‚Äî to be used as the synchronized operational guidance, the living, evolving reference as execution proceeds Web3 transformation of iBLOOMING & BGC.

## üîç CORE CONTEXT

For the past two years, iBLOOMING (Digital Product Platform) and BGC (Affiliate Marketing/MLM Structure) have been operating in parallel.

üéØ What we now call **ALPHA COIN** has **already been running in action** through BGC‚Äôs operational model as a **live simulation**.  
(Source ‚Üí [Day 2 Summary](https://github.com/myreceiptt/nota-markdown/blob/main/202508/iBLOOMING-Web3-Meeting-Day2.md#-presentation-bgc-marketing-model-by-kk))

Without declaring it as such, **BGC has effectively implemented Alpha Coin tokenomics**:

- **Purchase Credit** = Value Token  
- **Sales Point** = Activity Token / Reward Token  
- **Profit Sharing** = Holding-Based Reward  
- **Cross-App Utility** = Integration with iBLOOMING edu-products / Access to iBLOOMING  

üéØ That makes it unnecessary to reinvent, but essential to relabel, restructure, and upgrade the value layer already running since 2023.

## üß† STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES (Reaffirmed)

This token architecture is aimed at solving these five business needs:

1. **Increase Revenue (Money)**
2. **Reduce Operational & Product Cost**
3. **Reduce Tax Burden via On-Chain Logic**
4. **Grow Affiliate Network (More Affiliators)**
5. **Expand Active User Base (More Users)**

All of which will be simulated, measured, and validated via token behavior and utility.

## üß≠ NAVIGATION FOCUS

- ‚úÖ We are **not inventing from scratch**, we are formalizing and upgrading.
- ‚ùå Avoid branding this as ‚Äúmoving to Web3‚Äù ‚Äî users should experience value, not complexity.
- ‚úÖ Web3 is a mirror of our internal system ‚Äî not a replacement of our product philosophy.
