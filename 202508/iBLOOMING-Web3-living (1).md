# iBLOOMING Web3 – Living Guidance Document

📍 *This document serves as the operational and strategic guide for the Web3 transformation of iBLOOMING & BGC, based on collective discussions held on July 10 & 11, 2025.*

It is meant to be read, discussed, adjusted if needed, and ultimately agreed upon by all founders — then used as a living, evolving reference as execution proceeds.

## 🔍 CORE CONTEXT

For the past two years, iBLOOMING (Digital Product Platform) and BGC (Affiliate Marketing/MLM Structure) have been operating in parallel.

Without declaring it as such, **BGC has effectively implemented Alpha Coin tokenomics**:

- **Purchase Credit** = Value Token  
- **Sales Point** = Reward Token  
- **Profit Sharing** = Holding-Based Reward  
- **Cross-App Utility** = Access to iBLOOMING  

🎯 What we now call **ALPHA COIN** has already been running as a **live simulation**. This makes it unnecessary to reinvent, but essential to relabel, restructure, and upgrade.

## 🧱 THE 4 EXECUTION PILLARS – STATUS

| Pillar                      | Status             | Notes |
|-----------------------------|--------------------|-------|
| 1. Web3 Login               | ✅ Agreed           | Will be implemented starting from the iBLOOMING App |
| 2. ALPHA Coin Implementation| ✅ Already Running  | Data extraction needed for whitepaper formulation |
| 3. Tokenomics + WhitePaper  | 🛠️ Assigned         | Prof. NOTA to draft version 1 this week |
| 4. iBC/iBTC Release         | 🧪 Under Planning   | Requires deployment design and founder alignment |

## 📊 SIMULATED EXECUTION MATRIX – STATUS

Still valid as strategic framework, now evolving into:

- `Token-Flow-Map.md` = Full mapping of token interaction between BGC ↔ iBLOOMING  
- Resource & Role Allocation  
- Integration Path by Platform  

✅ Use as coordination grid for stakeholder assignment & responsibility planning.

## 🔜 NEXT STEPS (As of Meeting Day 2)

| Step | Description | Output File |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | Draft Tokenomics & WhitePaper (iBC / iBTC) | `iBLOOMING-Coin-WhitePaper-Draft.md` |
| 2 | Map Token Flow across BGC/iBLOOMING | `Token-Flow-Map.md` |
| 3 | Prepare Implementation Plan – Phase 1 | `Phase1-Implementation-Checklist.md` |
| 4 | Distribute to Founders for Feedback | Short Message:<br>_"This is the token architecture we’ve been running for 2 years — nothing is new, only elevated."_ |

## 🧭 NAVIGATION FOCUS

- ✅ We are **not inventing from scratch**, we are formalizing and upgrading.
- ❌ Avoid branding this as “moving to Web3” — users should experience value, not complexity.
- ✅ Web3 is a mirror of our internal system — not a replacement of our product philosophy.

## 🧠 STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES (Reaffirmed)

This token architecture is aimed at solving these five business needs:

1. **Increase Revenue (Money)**
2. **Reduce Operational & Product Cost**
3. **Reduce Tax Burden via On-Chain Logic**
4. **Grow Affiliate Network (More Affiliators)**
5. **Expand Active User Base (More Users)**

All of which will be simulated, measured, and validated via token behavior and utility.
