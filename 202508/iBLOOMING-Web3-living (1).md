# Living Document of Web3 Transformation Guidance

üìç *This document serves as the operational and strategic guide for the Web3 transformation of iBLOOMING & BGC, based on collective discussions held on July 10 & 11, 2025.*

It consolidates insights, confirms milestones, and instructs next steps following the meetings on:

- [üìÑ Day 1: 10 July 2025](https://github.com/myreceiptt/nota-markdown/blob/main/202507/iBLOOMING-Web3-Meeting-Day1.md)
- [üìÑ Day 2: 11 July 2025](https://github.com/myreceiptt/nota-markdown/blob/main/202508/iBLOOMING-Web3-Meeting-Day2.md)

It is meant to be always read, discussed, adjusted if needed, and agreed upon by all founders ‚Äî to be used as the synchronized operational guidance, the living, evolving reference as execution proceeds Web3 transformation of iBLOOMING & BGC.

## üîç CORE CONTEXT

For the past two years, iBLOOMING (Digital Product Platform) and BGC (Affiliate Marketing/MLM Structure) have been operating in parallel.

üéØ What we now call **ALPHA COIN** has **already been running in action** through BGC‚Äôs operational model as a **live simulation**.  
(Source ‚Üí [Day 2 Summary](https://github.com/myreceiptt/nota-markdown/blob/main/202508/iBLOOMING-Web3-Meeting-Day2.md#-presentation-bgc-marketing-model-by-kk))

Without declaring it as such, **BGC has effectively implemented Alpha Coin tokenomics**:

- **Purchase Credit** = Value Token  
- **Sales Point** = Activity Token / Reward Token  
- **Profit Sharing** = Holding-Based Reward  
- **Cross-App Utility** = Integration with iBLOOMING edu-products / Access to iBLOOMING  

üéØ This means we don‚Äôt need to recreate anything ‚Äî only to reframe, extract insights, and elevate the value logic already active since 2023.

---

## üß† STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES (Reaffirmed)

This token architecture is aimed at solving these five business needs:

1. **Increase Revenue (Money)**
2. **Reduce Operational & Product Cost**
3. **Reduce Tax Burden via On-Chain Logic**
4. **Grow Affiliate Network (More Affiliators)**
5. **Expand Active User Base (More Users)**

All of which will be simulated, measured, and validated via token behavior and utility.

| Tokenomics + WhitePaper (iBC/iBTC) | Use ALPHA Coin behavior data to design a real token economy.          | üõ†Ô∏è Agreed & Assigned       | Draft in progress by Prof. NOTA. Presented this week.         |
| iBC/iBTC Release & Utility         | Launch real token with reward + utility + BTC + governance functions. | üß™ Agreed & Under Planning | Requires deployment design, map, plan, and founder alignment. |

- `Token-Flow-Map.md` = Full mapping of token interaction between BGC ‚Üî iBLOOMING  
- Resource & Role Allocation  
- Integration Path by Platform  

‚úÖ Use as a coordination grid for stakeholder assignment & responsibility planning.

## üìä SIMULATED EXECUTION MATRIX

Original Strategy (10 July 2025): [Day 1: Simulated Execution Matrix Section](https://github.com/myreceiptt/nota-markdown/blob/main/202507/iBLOOMING-Web3-Meeting-Day1.md#-simulated-execution-matrix)

### üß© WEB3 LOGIN & SMART WALLET

- **Objective**: Enable user login via auto-generated smart wallets using Account Abstraction.
- **Simulation**: Wallet detection, auto-create flow, mobile-first login UX.
- **Team**: 1 Mobile Developer, 1 Web3 Engineer.
- **Est. Duration**: 1‚Äì2 months.
- **Status**: üß™ Agreed for implementation and under planning.
- **Notes**:
  - Start from mobile.
  - Use the Account Abstraction concept.

---

### üß© ALPHA COIN SYSTEM

- **Objective**: Reframe the existing BGC reward system as a behavioral simulation layer ("ALPHA Coin").
- **Simulation**: Not required ‚Äî the system has already been running for 2+ years.
- **Team**: Prof. NOTA, KK (data source).
- **Est. Duration**: 3 weeks (ongoing data extraction & interpretation).
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Already running and live within BGC.
- **Notes**:
  - No new token will be launched under the name Alpha Coin.  
  - The term is used to codify and interpret the BGC system‚Äôs behavioral dataset for iBC/iBTC tokenomics.  
  - ALPHA Coin = simulation lens, **not** a new product.

---

### üß© TOKENOMICS & BEHAVIORAL DESIGN

- **Objective**: Design the structure and logic of iBC/iBTC based on actual user behavior.
- **Simulation**: Use data from BGC (ALPHA Coin layer) to simulate incentive loops via collectible NFTs or access gates.
- **Team**: Prof. NOTA (Lead), KK (Data Source).
- **Est. Duration**: 1‚Äì2 months.
- **Status**: üõ†Ô∏è Agreed and already assigned, but not yet done.
- **Notes**:
  - Data from BGC and ALPHA Coin will inform value design and incentive flow.
  - No financial loss expected in simulation.  
  - NFTs are used only as symbolic spending tools, not as real assets, purely for modeling user behavior and decision patterns.

---

### üß© COIN RELEASE STRATEGY (iBC / iBTC)

- **Objective**: Strategize the release of a real token iBC/iBTC, including pricing, pairing, and value anchoring to BTC or fiat.
- **Simulation**: Ratio simulation, internal-use conversion, and early on-chain pairing design.
- **Team**: Prof. NOTA, 1 Web3 Engineer, 1 Ops/Legal.
- **Est. Duration**: 2‚Äì3 months.
- **Status**: üß™ Agreed for implementation and under planning.
- **Notes**:  
  - Critical for internal-external valuation sync and legal structuring.
  - Triggered by strategic questions from Yuku (Day 2).  
  - Will integrate ALPHA Coin data as a behavioral baseline for staking or governance modeling.

---

### üß© CROSS-APP TOKEN UTILITY

- **Objective**: Ensure the iBC/iBTC token is usable across all iBLOOMING and BGC apps as currency, access, or governance token.
- **Simulation**: Unified token logic and testing across platforms, including access, reward, and transaction flows.
- **Team**: To be confirmed.
- **Est. Duration**: TBD.
- **Status**: üõ†Ô∏è Being structured.
- **Notes**:  
  - Requires token standardization across applications and services.
  - Requires coordination of multiple dev environments and UX integration.

---

### üß© AFFILIATE INCENTIVE + TOKEN LOGIC

- **Objective**: Enhance the affiliate system using tokenized incentives and behavior-driven payouts.
- **Simulation**: None required ‚Äî already in use via BGC‚Äôs commission and reward logic.
- **Team**: Ongoing under BGC structure.
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Already live and active.
- **Notes**: Should be reverse-documented to inform token-based incentive modeling in iBC.

---

### üß© LEGAL & COMPLIANCE MAPPING

- **Objective**: Define a legal pathway for launching iBC/iBTC publicly or licensing its use.
- **Simulation**: Sandbox modeling, license-based access, and internal-use compliance.
- **Team**: Legal advisor, Prof. NOTA, external consultants.
- **Status**: üß≠ Under research.
- **Notes**: Will determine if the token can exit private/internal use into broader markets or third-party partnerships for a compliant launch.

---

### üß© BEHAVIORAL ANALYTICS

- **Objective**: Extract behavioral insights from users‚Äô interaction with the BGC system (ALPHA Coin layer) and future iBC/iBTC.
- **Simulation**: Continuous tracking of saving, spending, hoarding, and exchange behavior.
- **Team**: Prof. NOTA, Ops, Data Analyst (if available).
- **Status**: üß† To be analyzed post-simulation.
- **Notes**:  
  - Will inform iBC/iBTC‚Äôs staking, reward, and burn mechanisms.  
  - Behavioral analysis is the invisible spine of all token logic.

---

### üßæ FINAL NOTES

- This matrix is a **living strategy map**, not a finalized execution plan, and will evolve as iBLOOMING and BGC transition from simulation to production.
- Once the pillars are stabilized, each will translate into:
  - GitHub repositories (frontend/backend/contracts)
  - Milestone-based roadmaps (v0.1, v0.2, etc.)
  - Task assignments across Tech, Ops, Legal, and Creative
- Strategic clarity must remain grounded in **behavioral truth**, not speculative excitement.
- All matrix updates and field data will be recorded as part of the **living system log**.
