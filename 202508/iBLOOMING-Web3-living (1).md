# Living Document of Web3 Transformation Guidance

üìç *This document serves as the operational and strategic guide for the Web3 transformation of iBLOOMING & BGC, based on collective discussions held on July 10 & 11, 2025.*

It consolidates insights, confirms milestones, and instructs next steps following the meetings on:

- [üìÑ Day 1: 10 July 2025](https://github.com/myreceiptt/nota-markdown/blob/main/202507/iBLOOMING-Web3-Meeting-Day1.md)
- [üìÑ Day 2: 11 July 2025](https://github.com/myreceiptt/nota-markdown/blob/main/202508/iBLOOMING-Web3-Meeting-Day2.md)

It is meant to be always read, discussed, adjusted if needed, and agreed upon by all founders ‚Äî to be used as the synchronized operational guidance, the living, evolving reference as execution proceeds Web3 transformation of iBLOOMING & BGC.

## üîç CORE CONTEXT

For the past two years, iBLOOMING (Digital Product Platform) and BGC (Affiliate Marketing/MLM Structure) have been operating in parallel.

üéØ What we now call **ALPHA COIN** has **already been running in action** through BGC‚Äôs operational model as a **live simulation**.  
(Source ‚Üí [Day 2 Summary](https://github.com/myreceiptt/nota-markdown/blob/main/202508/iBLOOMING-Web3-Meeting-Day2.md#-presentation-bgc-marketing-model-by-kk))

Without declaring it as such, **BGC has effectively implemented Alpha Coin tokenomics**:

- **Purchase Credit** = Value Token  
- **Sales Point** = Activity Token / Reward Token  
- **Profit Sharing** = Holding-Based Reward  
- **Cross-App Utility** = Integration with iBLOOMING edu-products / Access to iBLOOMING  

üéØ That makes it unnecessary to reinvent, but essential to relabel, restructure, and upgrade the value layer already running since 2023.

---

## üß† STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES (Reaffirmed)

This token architecture is aimed at solving these five business needs:

1. **Increase Revenue (Money)**
2. **Reduce Operational & Product Cost**
3. **Reduce Tax Burden via On-Chain Logic**
4. **Grow Affiliate Network (More Affiliators)**
5. **Expand Active User Base (More Users)**

All of which will be simulated, measured, and validated via token behavior and utility.

|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Web3 Login System                  | Enable a unified wallet login system across iBLOOMING & BGC.          | üß™ Agreed & Under Planning | Will be implemented starting with mobile app.                 |
| ALPHA Coin Layer                   | Analyze earning & spending based on real data.                        | ‚úÖ Already Running         | Exist within the BGC system. Data extraction needed.          | 
| Tokenomics + WhitePaper (iBC/iBTC) | Use ALPHA Coin behavior data to design a real token economy.          | üõ†Ô∏è Agreed & Assigned       | Draft in progress by Prof. NOTA. Presented this week.         |
| iBC/iBTC Release & Utility         | Launch real token with reward + utility + BTC + governance functions. | üß™ Agreed & Under Planning | Requires deployment design, map, plan, and founder alignment. |

- `Token-Flow-Map.md` = Full mapping of token interaction between BGC ‚Üî iBLOOMING  
- Resource & Role Allocation  
- Integration Path by Platform  

‚úÖ Use as a coordination grid for stakeholder assignment & responsibility planning.

## üìä SIMULATED EXECUTION MATRIX

Original Strategy (10 July 2025): [Day 1: Simulated Execution Matrix Section](https://github.com/myreceiptt/nota-markdown/blob/main/202507/iBLOOMING-Web3-Meeting-Day1.md#-simulated-execution-matrix)

### üß© WEB3 LOGIN & SMART WALLET

- **Objective**: Enable user login via auto-generated smart wallets using Account Abstraction.
- **Simulation**: Wallet detection, auto-create flow, mobile-first login UX.
- **Team**: 1 Mobile Developer, 1 Web3 Engineer.
- **Est. Duration**: 1‚Äì2 months.
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Agreed for implementation.
- **Notes**:
  - Start from mobile.
  - Use Account Abstraction concept.

---

### üß© ALPHA COIN SYSTEM

- **Objective**: Reframe the existing BGC reward system as a behavioral simulation layer ("Alpha Coin").
- **Simulation**: Not required ‚Äî the system has already been running for 2+ years.
- **Team**: Prof. NOTA, KK (data source).
- **Est. Duration**: 3 weeks (ongoing data extraction & interpretation).
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Already running and live within BGC.
- **Notes**:

  - The term is used to codify and interpret the BGC system‚Äôs behavioral dataset for iBC tokenomics.  
  - Alpha Coin = simulation lens, **not** a new product.

---

## üßæ Final Notes

- This document acts as a **living strategy map**, not a finalized execution plan.
- Once each pillar is confirmed and matured, it may evolve into:
  - GitHub repositories (frontend/backend/contracts)
  - Milestone-based roadmaps (v0.1, v0.2, etc.)
  - Cross-functional task assignment (Tech, Ops, Legal)
- All matrix updates and field data will be recorded as part of the **living system log**.

## üß≠ NAVIGATION FOCUS

- ‚úÖ We are **not inventing from scratch**, we are formalizing and upgrading.
- ‚ùå Avoid branding this as ‚Äúmoving to Web3‚Äù ‚Äî users should experience value, not complexity.
- ‚úÖ Web3 is a mirror of our internal system ‚Äî not a replacement of our product philosophy.
